              "['I. YOU don\\'t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain\\'t no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly--Tom\\'s Aunt Polly, she is--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before. Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got six thousand dollars apiece--all gold. It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round--more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn\\'t stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back. The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn\\'t do nothing but sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time. When you got to the table you couldn\\'t go right to eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals, though there warn\\'t really anything the matter with them,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better. After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then I didn\\'t care no more about him, because I don\\'t take no stock in dead people. Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she wouldn\\'t. She said it was a mean practice and wasn\\'t clean, and I must try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They get down on a thing when they don\\'t know nothing about it. Here she was a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it. And she took snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she done it herself. Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on, had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then the widow made her ease up. I couldn\\'t stood it much longer. Then for an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say, \"Don\\'t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;\" and \"Don\\'t scrunch up like that, Huckleberry--set up straight;\" and pretty soon she would say, \"Don\\'t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don\\'t you try to behave?\" Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there. She got mad then, but I didn\\'t mean no harm. All I wanted was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn\\'t particular. She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn\\'t say it for the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place. Well, I couldn\\'t see no advantage in going where she was going, so I made up my mind I wouldn\\'t try for it. But I never said so, because it would only make trouble, and wouldn\\'t do no good. Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good place. She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn\\'t think much of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad about that, because I wanted him and me to be together. Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome. By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle, and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn\\'t no use. I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn\\'t make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that\\'s on its mind and can\\'t make itself understood, and so can\\'t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn\\'t need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I hadn\\'t no confidence. You do that when you\\'ve lost a horseshoe that you\\'ve found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn\\'t ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you\\'d killed a spider. I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn\\'t know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees--something was a stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I could just barely hear a \"me-yow! me-yow!\" down there. That was good! Says I, \"me-yow! me-yow!\" as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me. ',\n",
              " 'II. WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow\\'s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn\\'t scrape our heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson\\'s big nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and stretched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says: \"Who dah?\" He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn\\'t a sound, and we all there so close together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I dasn\\'t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back, right between my shoulders. Seemed like I\\'d die if I couldn\\'t scratch. Well, I\\'ve noticed that thing plenty times since. If you are with the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain\\'t sleepy--if you are anywheres where it won\\'t do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim says: \"Say, who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn\\' hear sumf\\'n. Well, I know what I\\'s gwyne to do: I\\'s gwyne to set down here and listen tell I hears it agin.\" So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears come into my eyes. But I dasn\\'t scratch. Then it begun to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn\\'t know how I was going to set still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in eleven different places now. I reckoned I couldn\\'t stand it more\\'n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon comfortable again. Tom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and we went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they\\'d find out I warn\\'t in. Then Tom said he hadn\\'t got candles enough, and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more. I didn\\'t want him to try. I said Jim might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was so still and lonesome. As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence, and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house. Tom said he slipped Jim\\'s hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn\\'t wake. Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance, and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back was all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he got so he wouldn\\'t hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim would happen in and say, \"Hm! What you know \\'bout witches?\" and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat. Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it. Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn\\'t touch it, because the devil had had his hands on it. Jim was most ruined for a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches. Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still and grand. We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore. We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our hands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn\\'t a noticed that there was a hole. We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says: \"Now, we\\'ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer\\'s Gang. Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name in blood.\" Everybody was willing. So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it, and he mustn\\'t eat and he mustn\\'t sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign of the band. And nobody that didn\\'t belong to the band could use that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever. Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got it out of his own head. He said, some of it, but the rest was out of pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had it. Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told the secrets. Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote it in. Then Ben Rogers says: \"Here\\'s Huck Finn, he hain\\'t got no family; what you going to do \\'bout him?\" \"Well, hain\\'t he got a father?\" says Tom Sawyer. \"Yes, he\\'s got a father, but you can\\'t never find him these days. He used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain\\'t been seen in these parts for a year or more.\" They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it wouldn\\'t be fair and square for the others. Well, nobody could think of anything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still. I was most ready to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss Watson--they could kill her. Everybody said: \"Oh, she\\'ll do. That\\'s all right. Huck can come in.\" Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with, and I made my mark on the paper. \"Now,\" says Ben Rogers, \"what\\'s the line of business of this Gang?\" \"Nothing only robbery and murder,\" Tom said. \"But who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle, or--\" \"Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain\\'t robbery; it\\'s burglary,\" says Tom Sawyer. \"We ain\\'t burglars. That ain\\'t no sort of style. We are highwaymen. We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.\" \"Must we always kill the people?\" \"Oh, certainly. It\\'s best. Some authorities think different, but mostly it\\'s considered best to kill them--except some that you bring to the cave here, and keep them till they\\'re ransomed.\" \"Ransomed? What\\'s that?\" \"I don\\'t know. But that\\'s what they do. I\\'ve seen it in books; and so of course that\\'s what we\\'ve got to do.\" \"But how can we do it if we don\\'t know what it is?\" \"Why, blame it all, we\\'ve _got_ to do it. Don\\'t I tell you it\\'s in the books? Do you want to go to doing different from what\\'s in the books, and get things all muddled up?\" \"Oh, that\\'s all very fine to _say_, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don\\'t know how to do it to them?--that\\'s the thing I want to get at. Now, what do you reckon it is?\" \"Well, I don\\'t know. But per\\'aps if we keep them till they\\'re ransomed, it means that we keep them till they\\'re dead.\" \"Now, that\\'s something _like_. That\\'ll answer. Why couldn\\'t you said that before? We\\'ll keep them till they\\'re ransomed to death; and a bothersome lot they\\'ll be, too--eating up everything, and always trying to get loose.\" \"How you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when there\\'s a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?\" \"A guard! Well, that _is_ good. So somebody\\'s got to set up all night and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. I think that\\'s foolishness. Why can\\'t a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here?\" \"Because it ain\\'t in the books so--that\\'s why. Now, Ben Rogers, do you want to do things regular, or don\\'t you?--that\\'s the idea. Don\\'t you reckon that the people that made the books knows what\\'s the correct thing to do? Do you reckon _you_ can learn \\'em anything? Not by a good deal. No, sir, we\\'ll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.\" \"All right. I don\\'t mind; but I say it\\'s a fool way, anyhow. Say, do we kill the women, too?\" \"Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn\\'t let on. Kill the women? No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that. You fetch them to the cave, and you\\'re always as polite as pie to them; and by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any more.\" \"Well, if that\\'s the way I\\'m agreed, but I don\\'t take no stock in it. Mighty soon we\\'ll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows waiting to be ransomed, that there won\\'t be no place for the robbers. But go ahead, I ain\\'t got nothing to say.\" Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was scared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn\\'t want to be a robber any more. So they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him mad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets. But Tom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and meet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people. Ben Rogers said he couldn\\'t get out much, only Sundays, and so he wanted to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on Sunday, and that settled the thing. They agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom Sawyer first captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started home. I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was dog-tired. ',\n",
              " 'III. WELL, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on account of my clothes; but the widow she didn\\'t scold, but only cleaned off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would behave awhile if I could. Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet and prayed, but nothing come of it. She told me to pray every day, and whatever I asked for I would get it. But it warn\\'t so. I tried it. Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks. It warn\\'t any good to me without hooks. I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I couldn\\'t make it work. By and by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to try for me, but she said I was a fool. She never told me why, and I couldn\\'t make it out no way. I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it. I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don\\'t Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork? Why can\\'t the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole? Why can\\'t Miss Watson fat up? No, says I to my self, there ain\\'t nothing in it. I went and told the widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was \"spiritual gifts.\" This was too many for me, but she told me what she meant--I must help other people, and do everything I could for other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it. I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn\\'t see no advantage about it--except for the other people; so at last I reckoned I wouldn\\'t worry about it any more, but just let it go. Sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body\\'s mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all down again. I judged I could see that there was two Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow\\'s Providence, but if Miss Watson\\'s got him there warn\\'t no help for him any more. I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong to the widow\\'s if he wanted me, though I couldn\\'t make out how he was a-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I was so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery. Pap he hadn\\'t been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable for me; I didn\\'t want to see him no more. He used to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around. Well, about this time he was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so people said. They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man was just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was all like pap; but they couldn\\'t make nothing out of the face, because it had been in the water so long it warn\\'t much like a face at all. They said he was floating on his back in the water. They took him and buried him on the bank. But I warn\\'t comfortable long, because I happened to think of something. I knowed mighty well that a drownded man don\\'t float on his back, but on his face. So I knowed, then, that this warn\\'t pap, but a woman dressed up in a man\\'s clothes. So I was uncomfortable again. I judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished he wouldn\\'t. We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned. All the boys did. We hadn\\'t robbed nobody, hadn\\'t killed any people, but only just pretended. We used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market, but we never hived any of them. Tom Sawyer called the hogs \"ingots,\" and he called the turnips and stuff \"julery,\" and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed and marked. But I couldn\\'t see no profit in it. One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan (which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand \"sumter\" mules, all loaded down with di\\'monds, and they didn\\'t have only a guard of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot and scoop the things. He said we must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready. He never could go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it, though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them till you rotted, and then they warn\\'t worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before. I didn\\'t believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill. But there warn\\'t no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn\\'t no camels nor no elephants. It warn\\'t anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class at that. We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut. I didn\\'t see no di\\'monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so. He said there was loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too, and elephants and things. I said, why couldn\\'t we see them, then? He said if I warn\\'t so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I would know without asking. He said it was all done by enchantment. He said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure, and so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they had turned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite. I said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians. Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull. \"Why,\" said he, \"a magician could call up a lot of genies, and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson. They are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church.\" \"Well,\" I says, \"s\\'pose we got some genies to help _us_--can\\'t we lick the other crowd then?\" \"How you going to get them?\" \"I don\\'t know. How do _they_ get them?\" \"Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies come tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the smoke a-rolling, and everything they\\'re told to do they up and do it. They don\\'t think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots, and belting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it--or any other man.\" \"Who makes them tear around so?\" \"Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring. They belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring, and they\\'ve got to do whatever he says. If he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di\\'monds, and fill it full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an emperor\\'s daughter from China for you to marry, they\\'ve got to do it--and they\\'ve got to do it before sun-up next morning, too. And more: they\\'ve got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it, you understand.\" \"Well,\" says I, \"I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keeping the palace themselves \\'stead of fooling them away like that. And what\\'s more--if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp.\" \"How you talk, Huck Finn. Why, you\\'d _have_ to come when he rubbed it, whether you wanted to or not.\" \"What! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church? All right, then; I _would_ come; but I lay I\\'d make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country.\" \"Shucks, it ain\\'t no use to talk to you, Huck Finn. You don\\'t seem to know anything, somehow--perfect saphead.\" I thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned I would see if there was anything in it. I got an old tin lamp and an iron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat like an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn\\'t no use, none of the genies come. So then I judged that all that stuff was only just one of Tom Sawyer\\'s lies. I reckoned he believed in the A-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different. It had all the marks of a Sunday-school. ',\n",
              " 'IV. WELL, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter now. I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty-five, and I don\\'t reckon I could ever get any further than that if I was to live forever. I don\\'t take no stock in mathematics, anyway. At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it. Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next day done me good and cheered me up. So the longer I went to school the easier it got to be. I was getting sort of used to the widow\\'s ways, too, and they warn\\'t so raspy on me. Living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that was a rest to me. I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. She said she warn\\'t ashamed of me. One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast. I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me, and crossed me off. She says, \"Take your hands away, Huckleberry; what a mess you are always making!\" The widow put in a good word for me, but that warn\\'t going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough. I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and wondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be. There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn\\'t one of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along low-spirited and on the watch-out. I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence. There was an inch of new snow on the ground, and I seen somebody\\'s tracks. They had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the garden fence. It was funny they hadn\\'t come in, after standing around so. I couldn\\'t make it out. It was very curious, somehow. I was going to follow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first. I didn\\'t notice anything at first, but next I did. There was a cross in the left boot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil. I was up in a second and shinning down the hill. I looked over my shoulder every now and then, but I didn\\'t see nobody. I was at Judge Thatcher\\'s as quick as I could get there. He said: \"Why, my boy, you are all out of breath. Did you come for your interest?\" \"No, sir,\" I says; \"is there some for me?\" \"Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night--over a hundred and fifty dollars. Quite a fortune for you. You had better let me invest it along with your six thousand, because if you take it you\\'ll spend it.\" \"No, sir,\" I says, \"I don\\'t want to spend it. I don\\'t want it at all--nor the six thousand, nuther. I want you to take it; I want to give it to you--the six thousand and all.\" He looked surprised. He couldn\\'t seem to make it out. He says: \"Why, what can you mean, my boy?\" I says, \"Don\\'t you ask me no questions about it, please. You\\'ll take it--won\\'t you?\" He says: \"Well, I\\'m puzzled. Is something the matter?\" \"Please take it,\" says I, \"and don\\'t ask me nothing--then I won\\'t have to tell no lies.\" He studied a while, and then he says: \"Oho-o! I think I see. You want to _sell_ all your property to me--not give it. That\\'s the correct idea.\" Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says: \"There; you see it says \\'for a consideration.\\' That means I have bought it of you and paid you for it. Here\\'s a dollar for you. Now you sign it.\" So I signed it, and left. Miss Watson\\'s nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do magic with it. He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed everything. So I went to him that night and told him pap was here again, for I found his tracks in the snow. What I wanted to know was, what he was going to do, and was he going to stay? Jim got out his hair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor. It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch. Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the same. Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it and listened. But it warn\\'t no use; he said it wouldn\\'t talk. He said sometimes it wouldn\\'t talk without money. I told him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warn\\'t no good because the brass showed through the silver a little, and it wouldn\\'t pass nohow, even if the brass didn\\'t show, because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it every time. (I reckoned I wouldn\\'t say nothing about the dollar I got from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball would take it, because maybe it wouldn\\'t know the difference. Jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball would think it was good. He said he would split open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next morning you couldn\\'t see no brass, and it wouldn\\'t feel greasy no more, and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball. Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it. Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened again. This time he said the hair-ball was all right. He said it would tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to. I says, go on. So the hair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me. He says: \"Yo\\' ole father doan\\' know yit what he\\'s a-gwyne to do. Sometimes he spec he\\'ll go \\'way, en den agin he spec he\\'ll stay. De bes\\' way is to res\\' easy en let de ole man take his own way. Dey\\'s two angels hoverin\\' roun\\' \\'bout him. One uv \\'em is white en shiny, en t\\'other one is black. De white one gits him to go right a little while, den de black one sail in en bust it all up. A body can\\'t tell yit which one gwyne to fetch him at de las\\'. But you is all right. You gwyne to have considable trouble in yo\\' life, en considable joy. Sometimes you gwyne to git hurt, en sometimes you gwyne to git sick; but every time you\\'s gwyne to git well agin. Dey\\'s two gals flyin\\' \\'bout you in yo\\' life. One uv \\'em\\'s light en t\\'other one is dark. One is rich en t\\'other is po\\'. You\\'s gwyne to marry de po\\' one fust en de rich one by en by. You wants to keep \\'way fum de water as much as you kin, en don\\'t run no resk, \\'kase it\\'s down in de bills dat you\\'s gwyne to git hung.\" When I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap his own self! ',\n",
              " 'V. I had shut the door to. Then I turned around and there he was. I used to be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much. I reckoned I was scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was mistaken--that is, after the first jolt, as you may say, when my breath sort of hitched, he being so unexpected; but right away after I see I warn\\'t scared of him worth bothring about. He was most fifty, and he looked it. His hair was long and tangled and greasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining through like he was behind vines. It was all black, no gray; so was his long, mixed-up whiskers. There warn\\'t no color in his face, where his face showed; it was white; not like another man\\'s white, but a white to make a body sick, a white to make a body\\'s flesh crawl--a tree-toad white, a fish-belly white. As for his clothes--just rags, that was all. He had one ankle resting on t\\'other knee; the boot on that foot was busted, and two of his toes stuck through, and he worked them now and then. His hat was laying on the floor--an old black slouch with the top caved in, like a lid. I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chair tilted back a little. I set the candle down. I noticed the window was up; so he had clumb in by the shed. He kept a-looking me all over. By and by he says: \"Starchy clothes--very. You think you\\'re a good deal of a big-bug, _don\\'t_ you?\" \"Maybe I am, maybe I ain\\'t,\" I says. \"Don\\'t you give me none o\\' your lip,\" says he. \"You\\'ve put on considerable many frills since I been away. I\\'ll take you down a peg before I get done with you. You\\'re educated, too, they say--can read and write. You think you\\'re better\\'n your father, now, don\\'t you, because he can\\'t? _I\\'ll_ take it out of you. Who told you you might meddle with such hifalut\\'n foolishness, hey?--who told you you could?\" \"The widow. She told me.\" \"The widow, hey?--and who told the widow she could put in her shovel about a thing that ain\\'t none of her business?\" \"Nobody never told her.\" \"Well, I\\'ll learn her how to meddle. And looky here--you drop that school, you hear? I\\'ll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better\\'n what _he_ is. You lemme catch you fooling around that school again, you hear? Your mother couldn\\'t read, and she couldn\\'t write, nuther, before she died. None of the family couldn\\'t before _they_ died. I can\\'t; and here you\\'re a-swelling yourself up like this. I ain\\'t the man to stand it--you hear? Say, lemme hear you read.\" I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the wars. When I\\'d read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a whack with his hand and knocked it across the house. He says: \"It\\'s so. You can do it. I had my doubts when you told me. Now looky here; you stop that putting on frills. I won\\'t have it. I\\'ll lay for you, my smarty; and if I catch you about that school I\\'ll tan you good. First you know you\\'ll get religion, too. I never see such a son.\" He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, and says: \"What\\'s this?\" \"It\\'s something they give me for learning my lessons good.\" He tore it up, and says: \"I\\'ll give you something better--I\\'ll give you a cowhide.\" He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says: \"_Ain\\'t_ you a sweet-scented dandy, though? A bed; and bedclothes; and a look\\'n\\'-glass; and a piece of carpet on the floor--and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard. I never see such a son. I bet I\\'ll take some o\\' these frills out o\\' you before I\\'m done with you. Why, there ain\\'t no end to your airs--they say you\\'re rich. Hey?--how\\'s that?\" \"They lie--that\\'s how.\" \"Looky here--mind how you talk to me; I\\'m a-standing about all I can stand now--so don\\'t gimme no sass. I\\'ve been in town two days, and I hain\\'t heard nothing but about you bein\\' rich. I heard about it away down the river, too. That\\'s why I come. You git me that money to-morrow--I want it.\" \"I hain\\'t got no money.\" \"It\\'s a lie. Judge Thatcher\\'s got it. You git it. I want it.\" \"I hain\\'t got no money, I tell you. You ask Judge Thatcher; he\\'ll tell you the same.\" \"All right. I\\'ll ask him; and I\\'ll make him pungle, too, or I\\'ll know the reason why. Say, how much you got in your pocket? I want it.\" \"I hain\\'t got only a dollar, and I want that to--\" \"It don\\'t make no difference what you want it for--you just shell it out.\" He took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was going down town to get some whisky; said he hadn\\'t had a drink all day. When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told me to mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick me if I didn\\'t drop that. Next day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher\\'s and bullyragged him, and tried to make him give up the money; but he couldn\\'t, and then he swore he\\'d make the law force him. The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that had just come, and he didn\\'t know the old man; so he said courts mustn\\'t interfere and separate families if they could help it; said he\\'d druther not take a child away from its father. So Judge Thatcher and the widow had to quit on the business. That pleased the old man till he couldn\\'t rest. He said he\\'d cowhide me till I was black and blue if I didn\\'t raise some money for him. I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and got drunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight; then they jailed him, and next day they had him before court, and jailed him again for a week. But he said _he_ was satisfied; said he was boss of his son, and he\\'d make it warm for _him_. When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him. So he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just old pie to him, so to speak. And after supper he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he\\'d been a fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn\\'t be ashamed of, and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him. The judge said he could hug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again; pap said he\\'d been a man that had always been misunderstood before, and the judge said he believed it. The old man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they cried again. And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand, and says: \"Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it. There\\'s a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain\\'t so no more; it\\'s the hand of a man that\\'s started in on a new life, and\\'ll die before he\\'ll go back. You mark them words--don\\'t forget I said them. It\\'s a clean hand now; shake it--don\\'t be afeard.\" So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried. The judge\\'s wife she kissed it. Then the old man he signed a pledge--made his mark. The judge said it was the holiest time on record, or something like that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room, which was the spare room, and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good old time; and towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sun-up. And when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it. The judge he felt kind of sore. He said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn\\'t know no other way. ',\n",
              " 'VI. WELL, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he went for me, too, for not stopping school. He catched me a couple of times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged him or outrun him most of the time. I didn\\'t want to go to school much before, but I reckoned I\\'d go now to spite pap. That law trial was a slow business--appeared like they warn\\'t ever going to get started on it; so every now and then I\\'d borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. Every time he got money he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed. He was just suited--this kind of thing was right in his line. He got to hanging around the widow\\'s too much and so she told him at last that if he didn\\'t quit using around there she would make trouble for him. Well, _wasn\\'t_ he mad? He said he would show who was Huck Finn\\'s boss. So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and catched me, and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, and crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn\\'t no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldn\\'t find it if you didn\\'t know where it was. He kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off. We lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights. He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon, and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on. Every little while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time, and licked me. The widow she found out where I was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn\\'t long after that till I was used to being where I was, and liked it--all but the cowhide part. It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking and fishing, and no books nor study. Two months or more run along, and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn\\'t see how I\\'d ever got to like it so well at the widow\\'s, where you had to wash, and eat on a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the time. I didn\\'t want to go back no more. I had stopped cussing, because the widow didn\\'t like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn\\'t no objections. It was pretty good times up in the woods there, take it all around. But by and by pap got too handy with his hick\\'ry, and I couldn\\'t stand it. I was all over welts. He got to going away so much, too, and locking me in. Once he locked me in and was gone three days. It was dreadful lonesome. I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn\\'t ever going to get out any more. I was scared. I made up my mind I would fix up some way to leave there. I had tried to get out of that cabin many a time, but I couldn\\'t find no way. There warn\\'t a window to it big enough for a dog to get through. I couldn\\'t get up the chimbly; it was too narrow. The door was thick, solid oak slabs. Pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time. But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work. There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out--big enough to let me through. Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap\\'s gun in the woods. I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in. Pap warn\\'t in a good humor--so he was his natural self. He said he was down town, and everything was going wrong. His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there\\'d be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would win this time. This shook me up considerable, because I didn\\'t want to go back to the widow\\'s any more and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it. Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn\\'t skipped any, and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round, including a considerable parcel of people which he didn\\'t know the names of, and so called them what\\'s-his-name when he got to them, and went right along with his cussing. He said he would like to see the widow get me. He said he would watch out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they dropped and they couldn\\'t find me. That made me pretty uneasy again, but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn\\'t stay on hand till he got that chance. The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got. There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for wadding, besides some tow. I toted up a load, and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I thought it all over, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and take to the woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn\\'t stay in one place, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow couldn\\'t ever find me any more. I judged I would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would. I got so full of it I didn\\'t notice how long I was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded. I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. While I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up, and went to ripping again. He had been drunk over in town, and laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at. A body would a thought he was Adam--he was just all mud. Whenever his liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he says: \"Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it\\'s like. Here\\'s the law a-standing ready to take a man\\'s son away from him--a man\\'s own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising. Yes, just as that man has got that son raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin\\' for _him_ and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him. And they call _that_ govment! That ain\\'t all, nuther. The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o\\' my property. Here\\'s what the law does: The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up\\'ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets him go round in clothes that ain\\'t fitten for a hog. They call that govment! A man can\\'t get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes I\\'ve a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes, and I _told_ \\'em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face. Lots of \\'em heard me, and can tell what I said. Says I, for two cents I\\'d leave the blamed country and never come a-near it agin. Them\\'s the very words. I says look at my hat--if you call it a hat--but the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it\\'s below my chin, and then it ain\\'t rightly a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o\\' stove-pipe. Look at it, says I--such a hat for me to wear--one of the wealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights. \"Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky here. There was a free nigger there from Ohio--a mulatter, most as white as a white man. He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain\\'t a man in that town that\\'s got as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed cane--the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State. And what do you think? They said he was a p\\'fessor in a college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything. And that ain\\'t the wust. They said he could _vote_ when he was at home. Well, that let me out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to? It was \\'lection day, and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn\\'t too drunk to get there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where they\\'d let that nigger vote, I drawed out. I says I\\'ll never vote agin. Them\\'s the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all me--I\\'ll never vote agin as long as I live. And to see the cool way of that nigger--why, he wouldn\\'t a give me the road if I hadn\\'t shoved him out o\\' the way. I says to the people, why ain\\'t this nigger put up at auction and sold?--that\\'s what I want to know. And what do you reckon they said? Why, they said he couldn\\'t be sold till he\\'d been in the State six months, and he hadn\\'t been there that long yet. There, now--that\\'s a specimen. They call that a govment that can\\'t sell a free nigger till he\\'s been in the State six months. Here\\'s a govment that calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a govment, and yet\\'s got to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free nigger, and--\" Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of language--mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give the tub some, too, all along, here and there. He hopped around the cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding first one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. But it warn\\'t good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that fairly made a body\\'s hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and rolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous. He said so his own self afterwards. He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid over him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe. After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens. That was always his word. I judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal the key, or saw myself out, one or t\\'other. He drank and drank, and tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn\\'t run my way. He didn\\'t go sound asleep, but was uneasy. He groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time. At last I got so sleepy I couldn\\'t keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning. I don\\'t know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and I was up. There was pap looking wild, and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes. He said they was crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say one had bit him on the cheek--but I couldn\\'t see no snakes. He started and run round and round the cabin, hollering \"Take him off! take him off! he\\'s biting me on the neck!\" I never see a man look so wild in the eyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he rolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way, and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and saying there was devils a-hold of him. He wore out by and by, and laid still a while, moaning. Then he laid stiller, and didn\\'t make a sound. I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed terrible still. He was laying over by the corner. By and by he raised up part way and listened, with his head to one side. He says, very low: \"Tramp--tramp--tramp; that\\'s the dead; tramp--tramp--tramp; they\\'re coming after me; but I won\\'t go. Oh, they\\'re here! don\\'t touch me--don\\'t! hands off--they\\'re cold; let go. Oh, let a poor devil alone!\" Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. I could hear him through the blanket. By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he see me and went for me. He chased me round and round the place with a clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me, and then I couldn\\'t come for him no more. I begged, and told him I was only Huck; but he laughed _such_ a screechy laugh, and roared and cussed, and kept on chasing me up. Once when I turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and dropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a minute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who. So he dozed off pretty soon. By and by I got the old split-bottom chair and clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down the gun. I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, then I laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down behind it to wait for him to stir. And how slow and still the time did drag along. ',\n",
              " 'VII. \"GIT up! What you \\'bout?\" I opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was. It was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep. Pap was standing over me looking sour and sick, too. He says: \"What you doin\\' with this gun?\" I judged he didn\\'t know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says: \"Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.\" \"Why didn\\'t you roust me out?\" \"Well, I tried to, but I couldn\\'t; I couldn\\'t budge you.\" \"Well, all right. Don\\'t stand there palavering all day, but out with you and see if there\\'s a fish on the lines for breakfast. I\\'ll be along in a minute.\" He unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank. I noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise. I reckoned I would have great times now if I was over at the town. The June rise used to be always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts--sometimes a dozen logs together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the wood-yards and the sawmill. I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t\\'other one out for what the rise might fetch along. Well, all at once here comes a canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding high like a duck. I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog, clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe. I just expected there\\'d be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they\\'d raise up and laugh at him. But it warn\\'t so this time. It was a drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore. Thinks I, the old man will be glad when he sees this--she\\'s worth ten dollars. But when I got to shore pap wasn\\'t in sight yet, and as I was running her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and willows, I struck another idea: I judged I\\'d hide her good, and then, \\'stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I\\'d go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a rough time tramping on foot. It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around a bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun. So he hadn\\'t seen anything. When he got along I was hard at it taking up a \"trot\" line. He abused me a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and that was what made me so long. I knowed he would see I was wet, and then he would be asking questions. We got five catfish off the lines and went home. While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about wore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you see, all kinds of things might happen. Well, I didn\\'t see no way for a while, but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of water, and he says: \"Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, you hear? That man warn\\'t here for no good. I\\'d a shot him. Next time you roust me out, you hear?\" Then he dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he had been saying give me the very idea I wanted. I says to myself, I can fix it now so nobody won\\'t think of following me. About twelve o\\'clock we turned out and went along up the bank. The river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the rise. By and by along comes part of a log raft--nine logs fast together. We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore. Then we had dinner. Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch more stuff; but that warn\\'t pap\\'s style. Nine logs was enough for one time; he must shove right over to town and sell. So he locked me in and took the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three. I judged he wouldn\\'t come back that night. I waited till I reckoned he had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that log again. Before he was t\\'other side of the river I was out of the hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder. I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug. I took all the coffee and sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot. I took fish-lines and matches and other things--everything that was worth a cent. I cleaned out the place. I wanted an axe, but there wasn\\'t any, only the one out at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that. I fetched out the gun, and now I was done. I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things. So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up at that place and didn\\'t quite touch ground. If you stood four or five foot away and didn\\'t know it was sawed, you wouldn\\'t never notice it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn\\'t likely anybody would go fooling around there. It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn\\'t left a track. I followed around to see. I stood on the bank and looked out over the river. All safe. So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods, and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp. I took the axe and smashed in the door. I beat it and hacked it considerable a-doing it. I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground--hard packed, and no boards. Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it--all I could drag--and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy see that something had been dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy touches. Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that. Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. Then I took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn\\'t drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the river. Now I thought of something else. So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house. I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw, for there warn\\'t no knives and forks on the place--pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking. Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the season. There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away, I don\\'t know where, but it didn\\'t go to the river. The meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake. I dropped pap\\'s whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it wouldn\\'t leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again. It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. I made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. I says to myself, they\\'ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me. And they\\'ll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things. They won\\'t ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass. They\\'ll soon get tired of that, and won\\'t bother no more about me. All right; I can stop anywhere I want to. Jackson\\'s Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well, and nobody ever comes there. And then I can paddle over to town nights, and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson\\'s Island\\'s the place. I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. When I woke up I didn\\'t know where I was for a minute. I set up and looked around, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and miles across. The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late. You know what I mean--I don\\'t know the words to put it in. I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty soon I made it out. It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it\\'s a still night. I peeped out through the willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water. I couldn\\'t tell how many was in it. It kept a-coming, and when it was abreast of me I see there warn\\'t but one man in it. Think\\'s I, maybe it\\'s pap, though I warn\\'t expecting him. He dropped below me with the current, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water, and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him. Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough--and sober, too, by the way he laid his oars. I didn\\'t lose no time. The next minute I was a-spinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank. I made two mile and a half, and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and people might see me and hail me. I got out amongst the driftwood, and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float. I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking away into the sky; not a cloud in it. The sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before. And how far a body can hear on the water such nights! I heard people talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too--every word of it. One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights now. T\\'other one said _this_ warn\\'t one of the short ones, he reckoned--and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and laughed, but he didn\\'t laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said let him alone. The first fellow said he \\'lowed to tell it to his old woman--she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn\\'t nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it was nearly three o\\'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn\\'t wait more than about a week longer. After that the talk got further and further away, and I couldn\\'t make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble, and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off. I was away below the ferry now. I rose up, and there was Jackson\\'s Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like a steamboat without any lights. There warn\\'t any signs of the bar at the head--it was all under water now. It didn\\'t take me long to get there. I shot past the head at a ripping rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the Illinois shore. I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside. I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town, three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling. A monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down, with a lantern in the middle of it. I watched it come creeping down, and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, \"Stern oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!\" I heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side. There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and laid down for a nap before breakfast. ',\n",
              " 'VIII. THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight o\\'clock. I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied. I could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees all about, and gloomy in there amongst them. There was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little breeze up there. A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly. I was powerful lazy and comfortable--didn\\'t want to get up and cook breakfast. Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep sound of \"boom!\" away up the river. I rouses up, and rests on my elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I hopped up, and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up--about abreast the ferry. And there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down. I knowed what was the matter now. \"Boom!\" I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat\\'s side. You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my carcass come to the top. I was pretty hungry, but it warn\\'t going to do for me to start a fire, because they might see the smoke. So I set there and watched the cannon-smoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide there, and it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the drownded carcass and stop there. So, says I, I\\'ll keep a lookout, and if any of them\\'s floating around after me I\\'ll give them a show. I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could have, and I warn\\'t disappointed. A big double loaf come along, and I most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out further. Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the shore--I knowed enough for that. But by and by along comes another one, and this time I won. I took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my teeth in. It was \"baker\\'s bread\"--what the quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone. I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied. And then something struck me. I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone and done it. So there ain\\'t no doubt but there is something in that thing--that is, there\\'s something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays, but it don\\'t work for me, and I reckon it don\\'t work for only just the right kind. I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. The ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I\\'d have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in close, where the bread did. When she\\'d got pretty well along down towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread, and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place. Where the log forked I could peep through. By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could a run out a plank and walked ashore. Most everybody was on the boat. Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more. Everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and says: \"Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he\\'s washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water\\'s edge. I hope so, anyway.\" I didn\\'t hope so. They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might. I could see them first-rate, but they couldn\\'t see me. Then the captain sung out: \"Stand away!\" and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and I judged I was gone. If they\\'d a had some bullets in, I reckon they\\'d a got the corpse they was after. Well, I see I warn\\'t hurt, thanks to goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder of the island. I could hear the booming now and then, further and further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn\\'t hear it no more. The island was three mile long. I judged they had got to the foot, and was giving it up. But they didn\\'t yet a while. They turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side, under steam, and booming once in a while as they went. I crossed over to that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to the town. I knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come a-hunting after me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods. I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain couldn\\'t get at them. I catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had supper. Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast. When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set on the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed; there ain\\'t no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you can\\'t stay so, you soon get over it. And so for three days and nights. No difference--just the same thing. But the next day I went exploring around down through the island. I was boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. I found plenty strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show. They would all come handy by and by, I judged. Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn\\'t far from the foot of the island. I had my gun along, but I hadn\\'t shot nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake, and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking. My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever I could. Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn\\'t hear nothing else. I slunk along another piece further, then listened again; and so on, and so on. If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too. When I got to camp I warn\\'t feeling very brash, there warn\\'t much sand in my craw; but I says, this ain\\'t no time to be fooling around. So I got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight, and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last year\\'s camp, and then clumb a tree. I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn\\'t see nothing, I didn\\'t hear nothing--I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a thousand things. Well, I couldn\\'t stay up there forever; so at last I got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast. By the time it was night I was pretty hungry. So when it was good and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the Illinois bank--about a quarter of a mile. I went out in the woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and says to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people\\'s voices. I got everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping through the woods to see what I could find out. I hadn\\'t got far when I hear a man say: \"We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about beat out. Let\\'s look around.\" I didn\\'t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in the old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe. I didn\\'t sleep much. I couldn\\'t, somehow, for thinking. And every time I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. So the sleep didn\\'t do me no good. By and by I says to myself, I can\\'t live this way; I\\'m a-going to find out who it is that\\'s here on the island with me; I\\'ll find it out or bust. Well, I felt better right off. So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day. I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island. A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying the night was about done. I give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods. I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming. So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two to listen. But I hadn\\'t no luck somehow; I couldn\\'t seem to find the place. But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees. I went for it, cautious and slow. By and by I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground. It most give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the fire. I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It was getting gray daylight now. Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson\\'s Jim! I bet I was glad to see him. I says: \"Hello, Jim!\" and skipped out. He bounced up and stared at me wild. Then he drops down on his knees, and puts his hands together and says: \"Doan\\' hurt me--don\\'t! I hain\\'t ever done no harm to a ghos\\'. I alwuz liked dead people, en done all I could for \\'em. You go en git in de river agin, whah you b\\'longs, en doan\\' do nuffn to Ole Jim, \\'at \\'uz awluz yo\\' fren\\'.\" Well, I warn\\'t long making him understand I warn\\'t dead. I was ever so glad to see Jim. I warn\\'t lonesome now. I told him I warn\\'t afraid of _him_ telling the people where I was. I talked along, but he only set there and looked at me; never said nothing. Then I says: \"It\\'s good daylight. Le\\'s get breakfast. Make up your camp fire good.\" \"What\\'s de use er makin\\' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck? But you got a gun, hain\\'t you? Den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries.\" \"Strawberries and such truck,\" I says. \"Is that what you live on?\" \"I couldn\\' git nuffn else,\" he says. \"Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?\" \"I come heah de night arter you\\'s killed.\" \"What, all that time?\" \"Yes--indeedy.\" \"And ain\\'t you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?\" \"No, sah--nuffn else.\" \"Well, you must be most starved, ain\\'t you?\" \"I reck\\'n I could eat a hoss. I think I could. How long you ben on de islan\\'?\" \"Since the night I got killed.\" \"No! W\\'y, what has you lived on? But you got a gun. Oh, yes, you got a gun. Dat\\'s good. Now you kill sumfn en I\\'ll make up de fire.\" So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him with his knife, and fried him. When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot. Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. Then when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied. By and by Jim says: \"But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat \\'uz killed in dat shanty ef it warn\\'t you?\" Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. He said Tom Sawyer couldn\\'t get up no better plan than what I had. Then I says: \"How do you come to be here, Jim, and how\\'d you get here?\" He looked pretty uneasy, and didn\\'t say nothing for a minute. Then he says: \"Maybe I better not tell.\" \"Why, Jim?\" \"Well, dey\\'s reasons. But you wouldn\\' tell on me ef I uz to tell you, would you, Huck?\" \"Blamed if I would, Jim.\" \"Well, I b\\'lieve you, Huck. I--_I run off_.\" \"Jim!\" \"But mind, you said you wouldn\\' tell--you know you said you wouldn\\' tell, Huck.\" \"Well, I did. I said I wouldn\\'t, and I\\'ll stick to it. Honest _injun_, I will. People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum--but that don\\'t make no difference. I ain\\'t a-going to tell, and I ain\\'t a-going back there, anyways. So, now, le\\'s know all about it.\" \"Well, you see, it \\'uz dis way. Ole missus--dat\\'s Miss Watson--she pecks on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said she wouldn\\' sell me down to Orleans. But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun\\' de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy. Well, one night I creeps to de do\\' pooty late, en de do\\' warn\\'t quite shet, en I hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but she didn\\' want to, but she could git eight hund\\'d dollars for me, en it \\'uz sich a big stack o\\' money she couldn\\' resis\\'. De widder she try to git her to say she wouldn\\' do it, but I never waited to hear de res\\'. I lit out mighty quick, I tell you. \"I tuck out en shin down de hill, en \\'spec to steal a skift \\'long de sho\\' som\\'ers \\'bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go \\'way. Well, I wuz dah all night. Dey wuz somebody roun\\' all de time. \\'Long \\'bout six in de mawnin\\' skifts begin to go by, en \\'bout eight er nine every skift dat went \\'long wuz talkin\\' \\'bout how yo\\' pap come over to de town en say you\\'s killed. Dese las\\' skifts wuz full o\\' ladies en genlmen a-goin\\' over for to see de place. Sometimes dey\\'d pull up at de sho\\' en take a res\\' b\\'fo\\' dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to know all \\'bout de killin\\'. I \\'uz powerful sorry you\\'s killed, Huck, but I ain\\'t no mo\\' now. \"I laid dah under de shavin\\'s all day. I \\'uz hungry, but I warn\\'t afeard; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin\\' to start to de camp-meet\\'n\\' right arter breakfas\\' en be gone all day, en dey knows I goes off wid de cattle \\'bout daylight, so dey wouldn\\' \\'spec to see me roun\\' de place, en so dey wouldn\\' miss me tell arter dark in de evenin\\'. De yuther servants wouldn\\' miss me, kase dey\\'d shin out en take holiday soon as de ole folks \\'uz out\\'n de way. \"Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went \\'bout two mile er more to whah dey warn\\'t no houses. I\\'d made up my mine \\'bout what I\\'s agwyne to do. You see, ef I kep\\' on tryin\\' to git away afoot, de dogs \\'ud track me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey\\'d miss dat skift, you see, en dey\\'d know \\'bout whah I\\'d lan\\' on de yuther side, en whah to pick up my track. So I says, a raff is what I\\'s arter; it doan\\' _make_ no track. \"I see a light a-comin\\' roun\\' de p\\'int bymeby, so I wade\\' in en shove\\' a log ahead o\\' me en swum more\\'n half way acrost de river, en got in \\'mongst de drift-wood, en kep\\' my head down low, en kinder swum agin de current tell de raff come along. Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck a-holt. It clouded up en \\'uz pooty dark for a little while. So I clumb up en laid down on de planks. De men \\'uz all \\'way yonder in de middle, whah de lantern wuz. De river wuz a-risin\\', en dey wuz a good current; so I reck\\'n\\'d \\'at by fo\\' in de mawnin\\' I\\'d be twenty-five mile down de river, en den I\\'d slip in jis b\\'fo\\' daylight en swim asho\\', en take to de woods on de Illinois side. \"But I didn\\' have no luck. When we \\'uz mos\\' down to de head er de islan\\' a man begin to come aft wid de lantern, I see it warn\\'t no use fer to wait, so I slid overboard en struck out fer de islan\\'. Well, I had a notion I could lan\\' mos\\' anywhers, but I couldn\\'t--bank too bluff. I \\'uz mos\\' to de foot er de islan\\' b\\'fo\\' I found\\' a good place. I went into de woods en jedged I wouldn\\' fool wid raffs no mo\\', long as dey move de lantern roun\\' so. I had my pipe en a plug er dog-leg, en some matches in my cap, en dey warn\\'t wet, so I \\'uz all right.\" \"And so you ain\\'t had no meat nor bread to eat all this time? Why didn\\'t you get mud-turkles?\" \"How you gwyne to git \\'m? You can\\'t slip up on um en grab um; en how\\'s a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock? How could a body do it in de night? En I warn\\'t gwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime.\" \"Well, that\\'s so. You\\'ve had to keep in the woods all the time, of course. Did you hear \\'em shooting the cannon?\" \"Oh, yes. I knowed dey was arter you. I see um go by heah--watched um thoo de bushes.\" Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and lighting. Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain. He said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the same way when young birds done it. I was going to catch some of them, but Jim wouldn\\'t let me. He said it was death. He said his father laid mighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old granny said his father would die, and he did. And Jim said you mustn\\'t count the things you are going to cook for dinner, because that would bring bad luck. The same if you shook the table-cloth after sundown. And he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die. Jim said bees wouldn\\'t sting idiots; but I didn\\'t believe that, because I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn\\'t sting me. I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. Jim knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked him if there warn\\'t any good-luck signs. He says: \"Mighty few--an\\' _dey_ ain\\'t no use to a body. What you want to know when good luck\\'s a-comin\\' for? Want to keep it off?\" And he said: \"Ef you\\'s got hairy arms en a hairy breas\\', it\\'s a sign dat you\\'s agwyne to be rich. Well, dey\\'s some use in a sign like dat, \\'kase it\\'s so fur ahead. You see, maybe you\\'s got to be po\\' a long time fust, en so you might git discourage\\' en kill yo\\'sef \\'f you didn\\' know by de sign dat you gwyne to be rich bymeby.\" \"Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?\" \"What\\'s de use to ax dat question? Don\\'t you see I has?\" \"Well, are you rich?\" \"No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin. Wunst I had foteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat\\'n\\', en got busted out.\" \"What did you speculate in, Jim?\" \"Well, fust I tackled stock.\" \"What kind of stock?\" \"Why, live stock--cattle, you know. I put ten dollars in a cow. But I ain\\' gwyne to resk no mo\\' money in stock. De cow up \\'n\\' died on my han\\'s.\" \"So you lost the ten dollars.\" \"No, I didn\\'t lose it all. I on\\'y los\\' \\'bout nine of it. I sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents.\" \"You had five dollars and ten cents left. Did you speculate any more?\" \"Yes. You know that one-laigged nigger dat b\\'longs to old Misto Bradish? Well, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a dollar would git fo\\' dollars mo\\' at de en\\' er de year. Well, all de niggers went in, but dey didn\\'t have much. I wuz de on\\'y one dat had much. So I stuck out for mo\\' dan fo\\' dollars, en I said \\'f I didn\\' git it I\\'d start a bank mysef. Well, o\\' course dat nigger want\\' to keep me out er de business, bekase he says dey warn\\'t business \\'nough for two banks, so he say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de en\\' er de year. \"So I done it. Den I reck\\'n\\'d I\\'d inves\\' de thirty-five dollars right off en keep things a-movin\\'. Dey wuz a nigger name\\' Bob, dat had ketched a wood-flat, en his marster didn\\' know it; en I bought it off\\'n him en told him to take de thirty-five dollars when de en\\' er de year come; but somebody stole de wood-flat dat night, en nex day de one-laigged nigger say de bank\\'s busted. So dey didn\\' none uv us git no money.\" \"What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?\" \"Well, I \\'uz gwyne to spen\\' it, but I had a dream, en de dream tole me to give it to a nigger name\\' Balum--Balum\\'s Ass dey call him for short; he\\'s one er dem chuckleheads, you know. But he\\'s lucky, dey say, en I see I warn\\'t lucky. De dream say let Balum inves\\' de ten cents en he\\'d make a raise for me. Well, Balum he tuck de money, en when he wuz in church he hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po\\' len\\' to de Lord, en boun\\' to git his money back a hund\\'d times. So Balum he tuck en give de ten cents to de po\\', en laid low to see what wuz gwyne to come of it.\" \"Well, what did come of it, Jim?\" \"Nuffn never come of it. I couldn\\' manage to k\\'leck dat money no way; en Balum he couldn\\'. I ain\\' gwyne to len\\' no mo\\' money \\'dout I see de security. Boun\\' to git yo\\' money back a hund\\'d times, de preacher says! Ef I could git de ten _cents_ back, I\\'d call it squah, en be glad er de chanst.\" \"Well, it\\'s all right anyway, Jim, long as you\\'re going to be rich again some time or other.\" \"Yes; en I\\'s rich now, come to look at it. I owns mysef, en I\\'s wuth eight hund\\'d dollars. I wisht I had de money, I wouldn\\' want no mo\\'.\" ',\n",
              " 'IX. I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island that I\\'d found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it, because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide. This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and the bushes so thick. We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the side towards Illinois. The cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it. It was cool in there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we didn\\'t want to be climbing up and down there all the time. Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island, and they would never find us without dogs. And, besides, he said them little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to get wet? So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern, and lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner. The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a good place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner. We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there. We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern. Pretty soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was right about it. Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury, too, and I never see the wind blow so. It was one of these regular summer storms. It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and blackest--_FST_! it was as bright as glory, and you\\'d have a little glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm, hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again in a second, and now you\\'d hear the thunder let go with an awful crash, and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs--where it\\'s long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know. \"Jim, this is nice,\" I says. \"I wouldn\\'t want to be nowhere else but here. Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread.\" \"Well, you wouldn\\'t a ben here \\'f it hadn\\'t a ben for Jim. You\\'d a ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner, en gittn\\' mos\\' drownded, too; dat you would, honey. Chickens knows when it\\'s gwyne to rain, en so do de birds, chile.\" The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at last it was over the banks. The water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom. On that side it was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same old distance across--a half a mile--because the Missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs. Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside. We went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way. Well, on every old broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles--they would slide off in the water. The ridge our cavern was in was full of them. We could a had pets enough if we\\'d wanted them. One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft--nice pine planks. It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and the top stood above water six or seven inches--a solid, level floor. We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go; we didn\\'t show ourselves in daylight. Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side. She was a two-story, and tilted over considerable. We paddled out and got aboard--clumb in at an upstairs window. But it was too dark to see yet, so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight. The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island. Then we looked in at the window. We could make out a bed, and a table, and two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there was clothes hanging against the wall. There was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man. So Jim says: \"Hello, you!\" But it didn\\'t budge. So I hollered again, and then Jim says: \"De man ain\\'t asleep--he\\'s dead. You hold still--I\\'ll go en see.\" He went, and bent down and looked, and says: \"It\\'s a dead man. Yes, indeedy; naked, too. He\\'s ben shot in de back. I reck\\'n he\\'s ben dead two er three days. Come in, Huck, but doan\\' look at his face--it\\'s too gashly.\" I didn\\'t look at him at all. Jim throwed some old rags over him, but he needn\\'t done it; I didn\\'t want to see him. There was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles, and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal. There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some women\\'s underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men\\'s clothing, too. We put the lot into the canoe--it might come good. There was a boy\\'s old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too. And there was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck. We would a took the bottle, but it was broke. There was a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke. They stood open, but there warn\\'t nothing left in them that was any account. The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a hurry, and warn\\'t fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff. We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar, and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn\\'t have no label on them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb, and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg. The straps was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn\\'t find the other one, though we hunted all around. And so, take it all around, we made a good haul. When we was ready to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off. I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most a half a mile doing it. I crept up the dead water under the bank, and hadn\\'t no accidents and didn\\'t see nobody. We got home all safe. ',\n",
              " 'X. AFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come to be killed, but Jim didn\\'t want to. He said it would fetch bad luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha\\'nt us; he said a man that warn\\'t buried was more likely to go a-ha\\'nting around than one that was planted and comfortable. That sounded pretty reasonable, so I didn\\'t say no more; but I couldn\\'t keep from studying over it and wishing I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for. We rummaged the clothes we\\'d got, and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat. Jim said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat, because if they\\'d a knowed the money was there they wouldn\\'t a left it. I said I reckoned they killed him, too; but Jim didn\\'t want to talk about that. I says: \"Now you think it\\'s bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched in the snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday? You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin with my hands. Well, here\\'s your bad luck! We\\'ve raked in all this truck and eight dollars besides. I wish we could have some bad luck like this every day, Jim.\" \"Never you mind, honey, never you mind. Don\\'t you git too peart. It\\'s a-comin\\'. Mind I tell you, it\\'s a-comin\\'.\" It did come, too. It was a Tuesday that we had that talk. Well, after dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge, and got out of tobacco. I went to the cavern to get some, and found a rattlesnake in there. I killed him, and curled him up on the foot of Jim\\'s blanket, ever so natural, thinking there\\'d be some fun when Jim found him there. Well, by night I forgot all about the snake, and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light the snake\\'s mate was there, and bit him. He jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring. I laid him out in a second with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap\\'s whisky-jug and begun to pour it down. He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. Jim told me to chop off the snake\\'s head and throw it away, and then skin the body and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he eat it and said it would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist, too. He said that that would help. Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn\\'t going to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it. Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big, and so did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was all right; but I\\'d druther been bit with a snake than pap\\'s whisky. Jim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all gone and he was around again. I made up my mind I wouldn\\'t ever take a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time. And he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn\\'t got to the end of it yet. He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin in his hand. Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I\\'ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do. Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than two years he got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so they say, but I didn\\'t see it. Pap told me. But anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way, like a fool. Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds. We couldn\\'t handle him, of course; he would a flung us into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet, and there was a spool in it. Jim said he\\'d had it there a long time, to coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn\\'t ever seen a bigger one. He would a been worth a good deal over at the village. They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house there; everybody buys some of him; his meat\\'s as white as snow and makes a good fry. Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a stirring up some way. I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and find out what was going on. Jim liked that notion; but he said I must go in the dark and look sharp. Then he studied it over and said, couldn\\'t I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl? That was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of the calico gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it. Jim hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. I put on the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe. Jim said nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly. I practiced around all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty well in them, only Jim said I didn\\'t walk like a girl; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket. I took notice, and done better. I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark. I started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town. I tied up and started along the bank. There was a light burning in a little shanty that hadn\\'t been lived in for a long time, and I wondered who had took up quarters there. I slipped up and peeped in at the window. There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table. I didn\\'t know her face; she was a stranger, for you couldn\\'t start a face in that town that I didn\\'t know. Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had come; people might know my voice and find me out. But if this woman had been in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to know; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn\\'t forget I was a girl. ',\n",
              " 'XI. \"COME in,\" says the woman, and I did. She says: \"Take a cheer.\" I done it. She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes, and says: \"What might your name be?\" \"Sarah Williams.\" \"Where \\'bouts do you live? In this neighborhood?\\' \"No\\'m. In Hookerville, seven mile below. I\\'ve walked all the way and I\\'m all tired out.\" \"Hungry, too, I reckon. I\\'ll find you something.\" \"No\\'m, I ain\\'t hungry. I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below here at a farm; so I ain\\'t hungry no more. It\\'s what makes me so late. My mother\\'s down sick, and out of money and everything, and I come to tell my uncle Abner Moore. He lives at the upper end of the town, she says. I hain\\'t ever been here before. Do you know him?\" \"No; but I don\\'t know everybody yet. I haven\\'t lived here quite two weeks. It\\'s a considerable ways to the upper end of the town. You better stay here all night. Take off your bonnet.\" \"No,\" I says; \"I\\'ll rest a while, I reckon, and go on. I ain\\'t afeared of the dark.\" She said she wouldn\\'t let me go by myself, but her husband would be in by and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she\\'d send him along with me. Then she got to talking about her husband, and about her relations up the river, and her relations down the river, and about how much better off they used to was, and how they didn\\'t know but they\\'d made a mistake coming to our town, instead of letting well alone--and so on and so on, till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along. She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars (only she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and what a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was murdered. I says: \"Who done it? We\\'ve heard considerable about these goings on down in Hookerville, but we don\\'t know who \\'twas that killed Huck Finn.\" \"Well, I reckon there\\'s a right smart chance of people _here_ that\\'d like to know who killed him. Some think old Finn done it himself.\" \"No--is that so?\" \"Most everybody thought it at first. He\\'ll never know how nigh he come to getting lynched. But before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named Jim.\" \"Why _he_--\" I stopped. I reckoned I better keep still. She run on, and never noticed I had put in at all: \"The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed. So there\\'s a reward out for him--three hundred dollars. And there\\'s a reward out for old Finn, too--two hundred dollars. You see, he come to town the morning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with \\'em on the ferryboat hunt, and right away after he up and left. Before night they wanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see. Well, next day they found out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn\\'t ben seen sence ten o\\'clock the night the murder was done. So then they put it on him, you see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn, and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and that evening he got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hard-looking strangers, and then went off with them. Well, he hain\\'t come back sence, and they ain\\'t looking for him back till this thing blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he\\'d get Huck\\'s money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit. People do say he warn\\'t any too good to do it. Oh, he\\'s sly, I reckon. If he don\\'t come back for a year he\\'ll be all right. You can\\'t prove anything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down then, and he\\'ll walk in Huck\\'s money as easy as nothing.\" \"Yes, I reckon so, \\'m. I don\\'t see nothing in the way of it. Has everybody quit thinking the nigger done it?\" \"Oh, no, not everybody. A good many thinks he done it. But they\\'ll get the nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare it out of him.\" \"Why, are they after him yet?\" \"Well, you\\'re innocent, ain\\'t you! Does three hundred dollars lay around every day for people to pick up? Some folks think the nigger ain\\'t far from here. I\\'m one of them--but I hain\\'t talked it around. A few days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder that they call Jackson\\'s Island. Don\\'t anybody live there? says I. No, nobody, says they. I didn\\'t say any more, but I done some thinking. I was pretty near certain I\\'d seen smoke over there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I says to myself, like as not that nigger\\'s hiding over there; anyway, says I, it\\'s worth the trouble to give the place a hunt. I hain\\'t seen any smoke sence, so I reckon maybe he\\'s gone, if it was him; but husband\\'s going over to see--him and another man. He was gone up the river; but he got back to-day, and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago.\" I had got so uneasy I couldn\\'t set still. I had to do something with my hands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it. When the woman stopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty curious and smiling a little. I put down the needle and thread, and let on to be interested--and I was, too--and says: \"Three hundred dollars is a power of money. I wish my mother could get it. Is your husband going over there to-night?\" \"Oh, yes. He went up-town with the man I was telling you of, to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun. They\\'ll go over after midnight.\" \"Couldn\\'t they see better if they was to wait till daytime?\" \"Yes. And couldn\\'t the nigger see better, too? After midnight he\\'ll likely be asleep, and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark, if he\\'s got one.\" \"I didn\\'t think of that.\" The woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn\\'t feel a bit comfortable. Pretty soon she says, \"What did you say your name was, honey?\" \"M--Mary Williams.\" Somehow it didn\\'t seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I didn\\'t look up--seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort of cornered, and was afeared maybe I was looking it, too. I wished the woman would say something more; the longer she set still the uneasier I was. But now she says: \"Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?\" \"Oh, yes\\'m, I did. Sarah Mary Williams. Sarah\\'s my first name. Some calls me Sarah, some calls me Mary.\" \"Oh, that\\'s the way of it?\" \"Yes\\'m.\" I was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway. I couldn\\'t look up yet. Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again. She was right about the rats. You\\'d see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner every little while. She said she had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone, or they wouldn\\'t give her no peace. She showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot with it generly, but she\\'d wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn\\'t know whether she could throw true now. But she watched for a chance, and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said \"Ouch!\" it hurt her arm so. Then she told me to try for the next one. I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course I didn\\'t let on. I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his nose I let drive, and if he\\'d a stayed where he was he\\'d a been a tolerable sick rat. She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I would hive the next one. She went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with. I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and went on talking about her and her husband\\'s matters. But she broke off to say: \"Keep your eye on the rats. You better have the lead in your lap, handy.\" So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped my legs together on it and she went on talking. But only about a minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face, and very pleasant, and says: \"Come, now, what\\'s your real name?\" \"Wh--what, mum?\" \"What\\'s your real name? Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?--or what is it?\" I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn\\'t know hardly what to do. But I says: \"Please to don\\'t poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum. If I\\'m in the way here, I\\'ll--\" \"No, you won\\'t. Set down and stay where you are. I ain\\'t going to hurt you, and I ain\\'t going to tell on you, nuther. You just tell me your secret, and trust me. I\\'ll keep it; and, what\\'s more, I\\'ll help you. So\\'ll my old man if you want him to. You see, you\\'re a runaway \\'prentice, that\\'s all. It ain\\'t anything. There ain\\'t no harm in it. You\\'ve been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut. Bless you, child, I wouldn\\'t tell on you. Tell me all about it now, that\\'s a good boy.\" So I said it wouldn\\'t be no use to try to play it any longer, and I would just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn\\'t go back on her promise. Then I told her my father and mother was dead, and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn\\'t stand it no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my chance and stole some of his daughter\\'s old clothes and cleared out, and I had been three nights coming the thirty miles. I traveled nights, and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. I said I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck out for this town of Goshen. \"Goshen, child? This ain\\'t Goshen. This is St. Petersburg. Goshen\\'s ten mile further up the river. Who told you this was Goshen?\" \"Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn into the woods for my regular sleep. He told me when the roads forked I must take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.\" \"He was drunk, I reckon. He told you just exactly wrong.\" \"Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain\\'t no matter now. I got to be moving along. I\\'ll fetch Goshen before daylight.\" \"Hold on a minute. I\\'ll put you up a snack to eat. You might want it.\" So she put me up a snack, and says: \"Say, when a cow\\'s laying down, which end of her gets up first? Answer up prompt now--don\\'t stop to study over it. Which end gets up first?\" \"The hind end, mum.\" \"Well, then, a horse?\" \"The for\\'rard end, mum.\" \"Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?\" \"North side.\" \"If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats with their heads pointed the same direction?\" \"The whole fifteen, mum.\" \"Well, I reckon you _have_ lived in the country. I thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again. What\\'s your real name, now?\" \"George Peters, mum.\" \"Well, try to remember it, George. Don\\'t forget and tell me it\\'s Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it\\'s George Elexander when I catch you. And don\\'t go about women in that old calico. You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe. Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don\\'t hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and poke the thread at it; that\\'s the way a woman most always does, but a man always does t\\'other way. And when you throw at a rat or anything, hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out to one side, like a boy. And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don\\'t clap them together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead. Why, I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I contrived the other things just to make certain. Now trot along to your uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I\\'ll do what I can to get you out of it. Keep the river road all the way, and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you. The river road\\'s a rocky one, and your feet\\'ll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I reckon.\" I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house. I jumped in, and was off in a hurry. I went up-stream far enough to make the head of the island, and then started across. I took off the sun-bonnet, for I didn\\'t want no blinders on then. When I was about the middle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the sound come faint over the water but clear--eleven. When I struck the head of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot. Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half below, as hard as I could go. I landed, and slopped through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern. There Jim laid, sound asleep on the ground. I roused him out and says: \"Git up and hump yourself, Jim! There ain\\'t a minute to lose. They\\'re after us!\" Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared. By that time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid. We put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn\\'t show a candle outside after that. I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look; but if there was a boat around I couldn\\'t see it, for stars and shadows ain\\'t good to see by. Then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade, past the foot of the island dead still--never saying a word. ',\n",
              " 'XII. IT must a been close on to one o\\'clock when we got below the island at last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow. If a boat was to come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois shore; and it was well a boat didn\\'t come, for we hadn\\'t ever thought to put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat. We was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things. It warn\\'t good judgment to put _everything_ on the raft. If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I built, and watched it all night for Jim to come. Anyways, they stayed away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn\\'t no fault of mine. I played it as low down on them as I could. When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had been a cave-in in the bank there. A tow-head is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth. We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we warn\\'t afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all day, and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. I told Jim all about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn\\'t set down and watch a camp fire--no, sir, she\\'d fetch a dog. Well, then, I said, why couldn\\'t she tell her husband to fetch a dog? Jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that time, or else we wouldn\\'t be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the village--no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again. So I said I didn\\'t care what was the reason they didn\\'t get us as long as they didn\\'t. When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an extra steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn\\'t have to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call a \"crossing\"; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn\\'t always run the channel, but hunted easy water. This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current that was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn\\'t ever feel like talking loud, and it warn\\'t often that we laughed--only a little kind of a low chuckle. We had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us at all--that night, nor the next, nor the next. Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides, nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. The fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up. In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful spread of lights at two o\\'clock that still night. There warn\\'t a sound there; everybody was asleep. Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o\\'clock at some little village, and buy ten or fifteen cents\\' worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn\\'t roosting comfortable, and took him along. Pap always said, take a chicken when you get a chance, because if you don\\'t want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does, and a good deed ain\\'t ever forgot. I never see pap when he didn\\'t want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to say, anyway. Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of that kind. Pap always said it warn\\'t no harm to borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn\\'t anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it. Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list and say we wouldn\\'t borrow them any more--then he reckoned it wouldn\\'t be no harm to borrow the others. So we talked it over all one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons, or what. But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and concluded to drop crabapples and p\\'simmons. We warn\\'t feeling just right before that, but it was all comfortable now. I was glad the way it come out, too, because crabapples ain\\'t ever good, and the p\\'simmons wouldn\\'t be ripe for two or three months yet. We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or didn\\'t go to bed early enough in the evening. Take it all round, we lived pretty high. The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself. When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead, and high, rocky bluffs on both sides. By and by says I, \"Hel-_lo_, Jim, looky yonder!\" It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock. We was drifting straight down for her. The lightning showed her very distinct. She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it, when the flashes come. Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like, I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river. I wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what there was there. So I says: \"Le\\'s land on her, Jim.\" But Jim was dead against it at first. He says: \"I doan\\' want to go fool\\'n \\'long er no wrack. We\\'s doin\\' blame\\' well, en we better let blame\\' well alone, as de good book says. Like as not dey\\'s a watchman on dat wrack.\" \"Watchman your grandmother,\" I says; \"there ain\\'t nothing to watch but the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody\\'s going to resk his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when it\\'s likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?\" Jim couldn\\'t say nothing to that, so he didn\\'t try. \"And besides,\" I says, \"we might borrow something worth having out of the captain\\'s stateroom. Seegars, I bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. Steamboat captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and _they_ don\\'t care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it. Stick a candle in your pocket; I can\\'t rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging. Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing? Not for pie, he wouldn\\'t. He\\'d call it an adventure--that\\'s what he\\'d call it; and he\\'d land on that wreck if it was his last act. And wouldn\\'t he throw style into it?--wouldn\\'t he spread himself, nor nothing? Why, you\\'d think it was Christopher C\\'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come. I wish Tom Sawyer _was_ here.\" Jim he grumbled a little, but give in. He said we mustn\\'t talk any more than we could help, and then talk mighty low. The lightning showed us the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and made fast there. The deck was high out here. We went sneaking down the slope of it to labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so dark we couldn\\'t see no sign of them. Pretty soon we struck the forward end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in front of the captain\\'s door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we seem to hear low voices in yonder! Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come along. I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just then I heard a voice wail out and say: \"Oh, please don\\'t, boys; I swear I won\\'t ever tell!\" Another voice said, pretty loud: \"It\\'s a lie, Jim Turner. You\\'ve acted this way before. You always want more\\'n your share of the truck, and you\\'ve always got it, too, because you\\'ve swore \\'t if you didn\\'t you\\'d tell. But this time you\\'ve said it jest one time too many. You\\'re the meanest, treacherousest hound in this country.\" By this time Jim was gone for the raft. I was just a-biling with curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn\\'t back out now, and so I won\\'t either; I\\'m a-going to see what\\'s going on here. So I dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft in the dark till there warn\\'t but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall of the texas. Then in there I see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol. This one kept pointing the pistol at the man\\'s head on the floor, and saying: \"I\\'d _like_ to! And I orter, too--a mean skunk!\" The man on the floor would shrivel up and say, \"Oh, please don\\'t, Bill; I hain\\'t ever goin\\' to tell.\" And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say: \"\\'Deed you _ain\\'t!_ You never said no truer thing \\'n that, you bet you.\" And once he said: \"Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn\\'t got the best of him and tied him he\\'d a killed us both. And what _for_? Jist for noth\\'n. Jist because we stood on our _rights_--that\\'s what for. But I lay you ain\\'t a-goin\\' to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner. Put _up_ that pistol, Bill.\" Bill says: \"I don\\'t want to, Jake Packard. I\\'m for killin\\' him--and didn\\'t he kill old Hatfield jist the same way--and don\\'t he deserve it?\" \"But I don\\'t _want_ him killed, and I\\'ve got my reasons for it.\" \"Bless yo\\' heart for them words, Jake Packard! I\\'ll never forgit you long\\'s I live!\" says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering. Packard didn\\'t take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill to come. I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat slanted so that I couldn\\'t make very good time; so to keep from getting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side. The man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my stateroom, he says: \"Here--come in here.\" And in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in I was up in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. Then they stood there, with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn\\'t see them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they\\'d been having. I was glad I didn\\'t drink whisky; but it wouldn\\'t made much difference anyway, because most of the time they couldn\\'t a treed me because I didn\\'t breathe. I was too scared. And, besides, a body _couldn\\'t_ breathe and hear such talk. They talked low and earnest. Bill wanted to kill Turner. He says: \"He\\'s said he\\'ll tell, and he will. If we was to give both our shares to him _now_ it wouldn\\'t make no difference after the row and the way we\\'ve served him. Shore\\'s you\\'re born, he\\'ll turn State\\'s evidence; now you hear _me_. I\\'m for putting him out of his troubles.\" \"So\\'m I,\" says Packard, very quiet. \"Blame it, I\\'d sorter begun to think you wasn\\'t. Well, then, that\\'s all right. Le\\'s go and do it.\" \"Hold on a minute; I hain\\'t had my say yit. You listen to me. Shooting\\'s good, but there\\'s quieter ways if the thing\\'s _got_ to be done. But what I say is this: it ain\\'t good sense to go court\\'n around after a halter if you can git at what you\\'re up to in some way that\\'s jist as good and at the same time don\\'t bring you into no resks. Ain\\'t that so?\" \"You bet it is. But how you goin\\' to manage it this time?\" \"Well, my idea is this: we\\'ll rustle around and gather up whatever pickins we\\'ve overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide the truck. Then we\\'ll wait. Now I say it ain\\'t a-goin\\' to be more\\'n two hours befo\\' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river. See? He\\'ll be drownded, and won\\'t have nobody to blame for it but his own self. I reckon that\\'s a considerble sight better \\'n killin\\' of him. I\\'m unfavorable to killin\\' a man as long as you can git aroun\\' it; it ain\\'t good sense, it ain\\'t good morals. Ain\\'t I right?\" \"Yes, I reck\\'n you are. But s\\'pose she _don\\'t_ break up and wash off?\" \"Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can\\'t we?\" \"All right, then; come along.\" So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled forward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse whisper, \"Jim!\" and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a moan, and I says: \"Quick, Jim, it ain\\'t no time for fooling around and moaning; there\\'s a gang of murderers in yonder, and if we don\\'t hunt up their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows can\\'t get away from the wreck there\\'s one of \\'em going to be in a bad fix. But if we find their boat we can put _all_ of \\'em in a bad fix--for the sheriff \\'ll get \\'em. Quick--hurry! I\\'ll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You start at the raft, and--\" \"Oh, my lordy, lordy! _raf\\'_? Dey ain\\' no raf\\' no mo\\'; she done broke loose en gone I--en here we is!\" ',\n",
              " 'XIII. WELL, I catched my breath and most fainted. Shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that! But it warn\\'t no time to be sentimentering. We\\'d _got_ to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves. So we went a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was, too--seemed a week before we got to the stern. No sign of a boat. Jim said he didn\\'t believe he could go any further--so scared he hadn\\'t hardly any strength left, he said. But I said, come on, if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix, sure. So on we prowled again. We struck for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the edge of the skylight was in the water. When we got pretty close to the cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough! I could just barely see her. I felt ever so thankful. In another second I would a been aboard of her, but just then the door opened. One of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone; but he jerked it in again, and says: \"Heave that blame lantern out o\\' sight, Bill!\" He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and set down. It was Packard. Then Bill _he_ come out and got in. Packard says, in a low voice: \"All ready--shove off!\" I couldn\\'t hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak. But Bill says: \"Hold on--\\'d you go through him?\" \"No. Didn\\'t you?\" \"No. So he\\'s got his share o\\' the cash yet.\" \"Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.\" \"Say, won\\'t he suspicion what we\\'re up to?\" \"Maybe he won\\'t. But we got to have it anyway. Come along.\" So they got out and went in. The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half second I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me. I out with my knife and cut the rope, and away we went! We didn\\'t touch an oar, and we didn\\'t speak nor whisper, nor hardly even breathe. We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, every last sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it. When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern show like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed by that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was. Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft. Now was the first time that I begun to worry about the men--I reckon I hadn\\'t had time to before. I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for murderers, to be in such a fix. I says to myself, there ain\\'t no telling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how would I like it? So says I to Jim: \"The first light we see we\\'ll land a hundred yards below it or above it, in a place where it\\'s a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, and then I\\'ll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung when their time comes.\" But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again, and this time worse than ever. The rain poured down, and never a light showed; everybody in bed, I reckon. We boomed along down the river, watching for lights and watching for our raft. After a long time the rain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering, and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we made for it. It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again. We seen a light now away down to the right, on shore. So I said I would go for it. The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck. We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told Jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars and shoved for the light. As I got down towards it three or four more showed--up on a hillside. It was a village. I closed in above the shore light, and laid on my oars and floated. As I went by I see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat. I skimmed around for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by and by I found him roosting on the bitts forward, with his head down between his knees. I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves, and begun to cry. He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was only me he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says: \"Hello, what\\'s up? Don\\'t cry, bub. What\\'s the trouble?\" I says: \"Pap, and mam, and sis, and--\" Then I broke down. He says: \"Oh, dang it now, _don\\'t_ take on so; we all has to have our troubles, and this \\'n \\'ll come out all right. What\\'s the matter with \\'em?\" \"They\\'re--they\\'re--are you the watchman of the boat?\" \"Yes,\" he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like. \"I\\'m the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deck-hand; and sometimes I\\'m the freight and passengers. I ain\\'t as rich as old Jim Hornback, and I can\\'t be so blame\\' generous and good to Tom, Dick, and Harry as what he is, and slam around money the way he does; but I\\'ve told him a many a time \\'t I wouldn\\'t trade places with him; for, says I, a sailor\\'s life\\'s the life for me, and I\\'m derned if _I\\'d_ live two mile out o\\' town, where there ain\\'t nothing ever goin\\' on, not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it. Says I--\" I broke in and says: \"They\\'re in an awful peck of trouble, and--\" \"_Who_ is?\" \"Why, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker; and if you\\'d take your ferryboat and go up there--\" \"Up where? Where are they?\" \"On the wreck.\" \"What wreck?\" \"Why, there ain\\'t but one.\" \"What, you don\\'t mean the Walter Scott?\" \"Yes.\" \"Good land! what are they doin\\' _there_, for gracious sakes?\" \"Well, they didn\\'t go there a-purpose.\" \"I bet they didn\\'t! Why, great goodness, there ain\\'t no chance for \\'em if they don\\'t git off mighty quick! Why, how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape?\" \"Easy enough. Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town--\" \"Yes, Booth\\'s Landing--go on.\" \"She was a-visiting there at Booth\\'s Landing, and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry to stay all night at her friend\\'s house, Miss What-you-may-call-her I disremember her name--and they lost their steering-oar, and swung around and went a-floating down, stern first, about two mile, and saddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck. Well, about an hour after dark we come along down in our trading-scow, and it was so dark we didn\\'t notice the wreck till we was right on it; and so _we_ saddle-baggsed; but all of us was saved but Bill Whipple--and oh, he _was_ the best cretur!--I most wish \\'t it had been me, I do.\" \"My George! It\\'s the beatenest thing I ever struck. And _then_ what did you all do?\" \"Well, we hollered and took on, but it\\'s so wide there we couldn\\'t make nobody hear. So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow. I was the only one that could swim, so I made a dash for it, and Miss Hooker she said if I didn\\'t strike help sooner, come here and hunt up her uncle, and he\\'d fix the thing. I made the land about a mile below, and been fooling along ever since, trying to get people to do something, but they said, \\'What, in such a night and such a current? There ain\\'t no sense in it; go for the steam ferry.\\' Now if you\\'ll go and--\" \"By Jackson, I\\'d _like_ to, and, blame it, I don\\'t know but I will; but who in the dingnation\\'s a-going\\' to _pay_ for it? Do you reckon your pap--\" \"Why _that\\'s_ all right. Miss Hooker she tole me, _particular_, that her uncle Hornback--\" \"Great guns! is _he_ her uncle? Looky here, you break for that light over yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and about a quarter of a mile out you\\'ll come to the tavern; tell \\'em to dart you out to Jim Hornback\\'s, and he\\'ll foot the bill. And don\\'t you fool around any, because he\\'ll want to know the news. Tell him I\\'ll have his niece all safe before he can get to town. Hump yourself, now; I\\'m a-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer.\" I struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went back and got into my skiff and bailed her out, and then pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among some woodboats; for I couldn\\'t rest easy till I could see the ferryboat start. But take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang, for not many would a done it. I wished the widow knowed about it. I judged she would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions and dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in. Well, before long here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding along down! A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out for her. She was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn\\'t much chance for anybody being alive in her. I pulled all around her and hollered a little, but there wasn\\'t any answer; all dead still. I felt a little bit heavy-hearted about the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if they could stand it I could. Then here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for the middle of the river on a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach I laid on my oars, and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for Miss Hooker\\'s remainders, because the captain would know her uncle Hornback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore, and I laid into my work and went a-booming down the river. It did seem a powerful long time before Jim\\'s light showed up; and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off. By the time I got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east; so we struck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and turned in and slept like dead people. ',\n",
              " 'XIV. BY and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and all sorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and three boxes of seegars. We hadn\\'t ever been this rich before in neither of our lives. The seegars was prime. We laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general good time. I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he said he didn\\'t want no more adventures. He said that when I went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly died, because he judged it was all up with _him_ anyway it could be fixed; for if he didn\\'t get saved he would get drownded; and if he did get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South, sure. Well, he was right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head for a nigger. I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such, and how gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called each other your majesty, and your grace, and your lordship, and so on, \\'stead of mister; and Jim\\'s eyes bugged out, and he was interested. He says: \"I didn\\' know dey was so many un um. I hain\\'t hearn \\'bout none un um, skasely, but ole King Sollermun, onless you counts dem kings dat\\'s in a pack er k\\'yards. How much do a king git?\" \"Get?\" I says; \"why, they get a thousand dollars a month if they want it; they can have just as much as they want; everything belongs to them.\" \"_Ain\\'_ dat gay? En what dey got to do, Huck?\" \"_They_ don\\'t do nothing! Why, how you talk! They just set around.\" \"No; is dat so?\" \"Of course it is. They just set around--except, maybe, when there\\'s a war; then they go to the war. But other times they just lazy around; or go hawking--just hawking and sp--Sh!--d\\' you hear a noise?\" We skipped out and looked; but it warn\\'t nothing but the flutter of a steamboat\\'s wheel away down, coming around the point; so we come back. \"Yes,\" says I, \"and other times, when things is dull, they fuss with the parlyment; and if everybody don\\'t go just so he whacks their heads off. But mostly they hang round the harem.\" \"Roun\\' de which?\" \"Harem.\" \"What\\'s de harem?\" \"The place where he keeps his wives. Don\\'t you know about the harem? Solomon had one; he had about a million wives.\" \"Why, yes, dat\\'s so; I--I\\'d done forgot it. A harem\\'s a bo\\'d\\'n-house, I reck\\'n. Mos\\' likely dey has rackety times in de nussery. En I reck\\'n de wives quarrels considable; en dat \\'crease de racket. Yit dey say Sollermun de wises\\' man dat ever live\\'. I doan\\' take no stock in dat. Bekase why: would a wise man want to live in de mids\\' er sich a blim-blammin\\' all de time? No--\\'deed he wouldn\\'t. A wise man \\'ud take en buil\\' a biler-factry; en den he could shet _down_ de biler-factry when he want to res\\'.\" \"Well, but he _was_ the wisest man, anyway; because the widow she told me so, her own self.\" \"I doan k\\'yer what de widder say, he _warn\\'t_ no wise man nuther. He had some er de dad-fetchedes\\' ways I ever see. Does you know \\'bout dat chile dat he \\'uz gwyne to chop in two?\" \"Yes, the widow told me all about it.\" \"_Well_, den! Warn\\' dat de beatenes\\' notion in de worl\\'? You jes\\' take en look at it a minute. Dah\\'s de stump, dah--dat\\'s one er de women; heah\\'s you--dat\\'s de yuther one; I\\'s Sollermun; en dish yer dollar bill\\'s de chile. Bofe un you claims it. What does I do? Does I shin aroun\\' mongs\\' de neighbors en fine out which un you de bill _do_ b\\'long to, en han\\' it over to de right one, all safe en soun\\', de way dat anybody dat had any gumption would? No; I take en whack de bill in _two_, en give half un it to you, en de yuther half to de yuther woman. Dat\\'s de way Sollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile. Now I want to ast you: what\\'s de use er dat half a bill?--can\\'t buy noth\\'n wid it. En what use is a half a chile? I wouldn\\' give a dern for a million un um.\" \"But hang it, Jim, you\\'ve clean missed the point--blame it, you\\'ve missed it a thousand mile.\" \"Who? Me? Go \\'long. Doan\\' talk to me \\'bout yo\\' pints. I reck\\'n I knows sense when I sees it; en dey ain\\' no sense in sich doin\\'s as dat. De \\'spute warn\\'t \\'bout a half a chile, de \\'spute was \\'bout a whole chile; en de man dat think he kin settle a \\'spute \\'bout a whole chile wid a half a chile doan\\' know enough to come in out\\'n de rain. Doan\\' talk to me \\'bout Sollermun, Huck, I knows him by de back.\" \"But I tell you you don\\'t get the point.\" \"Blame de point! I reck\\'n I knows what I knows. En mine you, de _real_ pint is down furder--it\\'s down deeper. It lays in de way Sollermun was raised. You take a man dat\\'s got on\\'y one or two chillen; is dat man gwyne to be waseful o\\' chillen? No, he ain\\'t; he can\\'t \\'ford it. _He_ know how to value \\'em. But you take a man dat\\'s got \\'bout five million chillen runnin\\' roun\\' de house, en it\\'s diffunt. _He_ as soon chop a chile in two as a cat. Dey\\'s plenty mo\\'. A chile er two, mo\\' er less, warn\\'t no consekens to Sollermun, dad fatch him!\" I never see such a nigger. If he got a notion in his head once, there warn\\'t no getting it out again. He was the most down on Solomon of any nigger I ever see. So I went to talking about other kings, and let Solomon slide. I told about Louis Sixteenth that got his head cut off in France long time ago; and about his little boy the dolphin, that would a been a king, but they took and shut him up in jail, and some say he died there. \"Po\\' little chap.\" \"But some says he got out and got away, and come to America.\" \"Dat\\'s good! But he\\'ll be pooty lonesome--dey ain\\' no kings here, is dey, Huck?\" \"No.\" \"Den he cain\\'t git no situation. What he gwyne to do?\" \"Well, I don\\'t know. Some of them gets on the police, and some of them learns people how to talk French.\" \"Why, Huck, doan\\' de French people talk de same way we does?\" \"_No_, Jim; you couldn\\'t understand a word they said--not a single word.\" \"Well, now, I be ding-busted! How do dat come?\" \"I don\\'t know; but it\\'s so. I got some of their jabber out of a book. S\\'pose a man was to come to you and say Polly-voo-franzy--what would you think?\" \"I wouldn\\' think nuff\\'n; I\\'d take en bust him over de head--dat is, if he warn\\'t white. I wouldn\\'t \\'low no nigger to call me dat.\" \"Shucks, it ain\\'t calling you anything. It\\'s only saying, do you know how to talk French?\" \"Well, den, why couldn\\'t he _say_ it?\" \"Why, he _is_ a-saying it. That\\'s a Frenchman\\'s _way_ of saying it.\" \"Well, it\\'s a blame ridicklous way, en I doan\\' want to hear no mo\\' \\'bout it. Dey ain\\' no sense in it.\" \"Looky here, Jim; does a cat talk like we do?\" \"No, a cat don\\'t.\" \"Well, does a cow?\" \"No, a cow don\\'t, nuther.\" \"Does a cat talk like a cow, or a cow talk like a cat?\" \"No, dey don\\'t.\" \"It\\'s natural and right for \\'em to talk different from each other, ain\\'t it?\" \"Course.\" \"And ain\\'t it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk different from _us_?\" \"Why, mos\\' sholy it is.\" \"Well, then, why ain\\'t it natural and right for a _Frenchman_ to talk different from us? You answer me that.\" \"Is a cat a man, Huck?\" \"No.\" \"Well, den, dey ain\\'t no sense in a cat talkin\\' like a man. Is a cow a man?--er is a cow a cat?\" \"No, she ain\\'t either of them.\" \"Well, den, she ain\\'t got no business to talk like either one er the yuther of \\'em. Is a Frenchman a man?\" \"Yes.\" \"_Well_, den! Dad blame it, why doan\\' he _talk_ like a man? You answer me _dat_!\" I see it warn\\'t no use wasting words--you can\\'t learn a nigger to argue. So I quit. ',\n",
              " 'XV. WE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at the bottom of Illinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that was what we was after. We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the Ohio amongst the free States, and then be out of trouble. Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a towhead to tie to, for it wouldn\\'t do to try to run in a fog; but when I paddled ahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast, there warn\\'t anything but little saplings to tie to. I passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current, and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went. I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and scared I couldn\\'t budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me--and then there warn\\'t no raft in sight; you couldn\\'t see twenty yards. I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke. But she didn\\'t come. I was in such a hurry I hadn\\'t untied her. I got up and tried to untie her, but I was so excited my hands shook so I couldn\\'t hardly do anything with them. As soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, right down the towhead. That was all right as far as it went, but the towhead warn\\'t sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot out into the solid white fog, and hadn\\'t no more idea which way I was going than a dead man. Thinks I, it won\\'t do to paddle; first I know I\\'ll run into the bank or a towhead or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it\\'s mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time. I whooped and listened. Away down there somewheres I hears a small whoop, and up comes my spirits. I went tearing after it, listening sharp to hear it again. The next time it come I see I warn\\'t heading for it, but heading away to the right of it. And the next time I was heading away to the left of it--and not gaining on it much either, for I was flying around, this way and that and t\\'other, but it was going straight ahead all the time. I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the time, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me. Well, I fought along, and directly I hears the whoop _behind_ me. I was tangled good now. That was somebody else\\'s whoop, or else I was turned around. I throwed the paddle down. I heard the whoop again; it was behind me yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its place, and I kept answering, till by and by it was in front of me again, and I knowed the current had swung the canoe\\'s head down-stream, and I was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering. I couldn\\'t tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don\\'t look natural nor sound natural in a fog. The whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared, the currrent was tearing by them so swift. In another second or two it was solid white and still again. I set perfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn\\'t draw a breath while it thumped a hundred. I just give up then. I knowed what the matter was. That cut bank was an island, and Jim had gone down t\\'other side of it. It warn\\'t no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes. It had the big timber of a regular island; it might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide. I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon. I was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don\\'t ever think of that. No, you _feel_ like you are laying dead still on the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don\\'t think to yourself how fast _you\\'re_ going, but you catch your breath and think, my! how that snag\\'s tearing along. If you think it ain\\'t dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try it once--you\\'ll see. Next, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears the answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn\\'t do it, and directly I judged I\\'d got into a nest of towheads, for I had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me--sometimes just a narrow channel between, and some that I couldn\\'t see I knowed was there because I\\'d hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks. Well, I warn\\'t long loosing the whoops down amongst the towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little while, anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o\\'-lantern. You never knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much. I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to keep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearing--it was floating a little faster than what I was. Well, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn\\'t hear no sign of a whoop nowheres. I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a snag, maybe, and it was all up with him. I was good and tired, so I laid down in the canoe and said I wouldn\\'t bother no more. I didn\\'t want to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn\\'t help it; so I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap. But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars was shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a big bend stern first. First I didn\\'t know where I was; I thought I was dreaming; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week. It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see by the stars. I looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the water. I took after it; but when I got to it it warn\\'t nothing but a couple of sawlogs made fast together. Then I see another speck, and chased that; then another, and this time I was right. It was the raft. When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his knees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar. The other oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt. So she\\'d had a rough time. I made fast and laid down under Jim\\'s nose on the raft, and began to gap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says: \"Hello, Jim, have I been asleep? Why didn\\'t you stir me up?\" \"Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck? En you ain\\' dead--you ain\\' drownded--you\\'s back agin? It\\'s too good for true, honey, it\\'s too good for true. Lemme look at you chile, lemme feel o\\' you. No, you ain\\' dead! you\\'s back agin, \\'live en soun\\', jis de same ole Huck--de same ole Huck, thanks to goodness!\" \"What\\'s the matter with you, Jim? You been a-drinking?\" \"Drinkin\\'? Has I ben a-drinkin\\'? Has I had a chance to be a-drinkin\\'?\" \"Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?\" \"How does I talk wild?\" \"_How_? Why, hain\\'t you been talking about my coming back, and all that stuff, as if I\\'d been gone away?\" \"Huck--Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye. _Hain\\'t_ you ben gone away?\" \"Gone away? Why, what in the nation do you mean? I hain\\'t been gone anywheres. Where would I go to?\" \"Well, looky here, boss, dey\\'s sumf\\'n wrong, dey is. Is I _me_, or who _is_ I? Is I heah, or whah _is_ I? Now dat\\'s what I wants to know.\" \"Well, I think you\\'re here, plain enough, but I think you\\'re a tangle-headed old fool, Jim.\" \"I is, is I? Well, you answer me dis: Didn\\'t you tote out de line in de canoe fer to make fas\\' to de tow-head?\" \"No, I didn\\'t. What tow-head? I hain\\'t see no tow-head.\" \"You hain\\'t seen no towhead? Looky here, didn\\'t de line pull loose en de raf\\' go a-hummin\\' down de river, en leave you en de canoe behine in de fog?\" \"What fog?\" \"Why, de fog!--de fog dat\\'s been aroun\\' all night. En didn\\'t you whoop, en didn\\'t I whoop, tell we got mix\\' up in de islands en one un us got los\\' en t\\'other one was jis\\' as good as los\\', \\'kase he didn\\' know whah he wuz? En didn\\'t I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible time en mos\\' git drownded? Now ain\\' dat so, boss--ain\\'t it so? You answer me dat.\" \"Well, this is too many for me, Jim. I hain\\'t seen no fog, nor no islands, nor no troubles, nor nothing. I been setting here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and I reckon I done the same. You couldn\\'t a got drunk in that time, so of course you\\'ve been dreaming.\" \"Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?\" \"Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn\\'t any of it happen.\" \"But, Huck, it\\'s all jis\\' as plain to me as--\" \"It don\\'t make no difference how plain it is; there ain\\'t nothing in it. I know, because I\\'ve been here all the time.\" Jim didn\\'t say nothing for about five minutes, but set there studying over it. Then he says: \"Well, den, I reck\\'n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it ain\\'t de powerfullest dream I ever see. En I hain\\'t ever had no dream b\\'fo\\' dat\\'s tired me like dis one.\" \"Oh, well, that\\'s all right, because a dream does tire a body like everything sometimes. But this one was a staving dream; tell me all about it, Jim.\" So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as it happened, only he painted it up considerable. Then he said he must start in and \"\\'terpret\" it, because it was sent for a warning. He said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good, but the current was another man that would get us away from him. The whoops was warnings that would come to us every now and then, and if we didn\\'t try hard to make out to understand them they\\'d just take us into bad luck, \\'stead of keeping us out of it. The lot of towheads was troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks, but if we minded our business and didn\\'t talk back and aggravate them, we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river, which was the free States, and wouldn\\'t have no more trouble. It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft, but it was clearing up again now. \"Oh, well, that\\'s all interpreted well enough as far as it goes, Jim,\" I says; \"but what does _these_ things stand for?\" It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar. You could see them first-rate now. Jim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash again. He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he couldn\\'t seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right away. But when he did get the thing straightened around he looked at me steady without ever smiling, and says: \"What do dey stan\\' for? I\\'se gwyne to tell you. When I got all wore out wid work, en wid de callin\\' for you, en went to sleep, my heart wuz mos\\' broke bekase you wuz los\\', en I didn\\' k\\'yer no\\' mo\\' what become er me en de raf\\'. En when I wake up en fine you back agin, all safe en soun\\', de tears come, en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yo\\' foot, I\\'s so thankful. En all you wuz thinkin\\' \\'bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie. Dat truck dah is _trash_; en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren\\'s en makes \\'em ashamed.\" Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there without saying anything but that. But that was enough. It made me feel so mean I could almost kissed _his_ foot to get him to take it back. It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger; but I done it, and I warn\\'t ever sorry for it afterwards, neither. I didn\\'t do him no more mean tricks, and I wouldn\\'t done that one if I\\'d a knowed it would make him feel that way. ',\n",
              " 'XVI. WE slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession. She had four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty men, likely. She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end. There was a power of style about her. It _amounted_ to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that. We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got hot. The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on both sides; you couldn\\'t see a break in it hardly ever, or a light. We talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it. I said likely we wouldn\\'t, because I had heard say there warn\\'t but about a dozen houses there, and if they didn\\'t happen to have them lit up, how was we going to know we was passing a town? Jim said if the two big rivers joined together there, that would show. But I said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again. That disturbed Jim--and me too. So the question was, what to do? I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed, and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo. Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and waited. There warn\\'t nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and not pass it without seeing it. He said he\\'d be mighty sure to see it, because he\\'d be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it he\\'d be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom. Every little while he jumps up and says: \"Dah she is?\" But it warn\\'t. It was Jack-o\\'-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set down again, and went to watching, same as before. Jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. Well, I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him, because I begun to get it through my head that he _was_ most free--and who was to blame for it? Why, _me_. I couldn\\'t get that out of my conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn\\'t rest; I couldn\\'t stay still in one place. It hadn\\'t ever come home to me before, what this thing was that I was doing. But now it did; and it stayed with me, and scorched me more and more. I tried to make out to myself that I warn\\'t to blame, because I didn\\'t run Jim off from his rightful owner; but it warn\\'t no use, conscience up and says, every time, \"But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody.\" That was so--I couldn\\'t get around that noway. That was where it pinched. Conscience says to me, \"What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word? What did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean? Why, she tried to learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how. _That\\'s_ what she done.\" I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead. I fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was fidgeting up and down past me. We neither of us could keep still. Every time he danced around and says, \"Dah\\'s Cairo!\" it went through me like a shot, and I thought if it _was_ Cairo I reckoned I would die of miserableness. Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. He was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the two children, and if their master wouldn\\'t sell them, they\\'d get an Ab\\'litionist to go and steal them. It most froze me to hear such talk. He wouldn\\'t ever dared to talk such talk in his life before. Just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free. It was according to the old saying, \"Give a nigger an inch and he\\'ll take an ell.\" Thinks I, this is what comes of my not thinking. Here was this nigger, which I had as good as helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would steal his children--children that belonged to a man I didn\\'t even know; a man that hadn\\'t ever done me no harm. I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him. My conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says to it, \"Let up on me--it ain\\'t too late yet--I\\'ll paddle ashore at the first light and tell.\" I felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off. All my troubles was gone. I went to looking out sharp for a light, and sort of singing to myself. By and by one showed. Jim sings out: \"We\\'s safe, Huck, we\\'s safe! Jump up and crack yo\\' heels! Dat\\'s de good ole Cairo at las\\', I jis knows it!\" I says: \"I\\'ll take the canoe and go and see, Jim. It mightn\\'t be, you know.\" He jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom for me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says: \"Pooty soon I\\'ll be a-shout\\'n\\' for joy, en I\\'ll say, it\\'s all on accounts o\\' Huck; I\\'s a free man, en I couldn\\'t ever ben free ef it hadn\\' ben for Huck; Huck done it. Jim won\\'t ever forgit you, Huck; you\\'s de bes\\' fren\\' Jim\\'s ever had; en you\\'s de _only_ fren\\' ole Jim\\'s got now.\" I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me. I went along slow then, and I warn\\'t right down certain whether I was glad I started or whether I warn\\'t. When I was fifty yards off, Jim says: \"Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on\\'y white genlman dat ever kep\\' his promise to ole Jim.\" Well, I just felt sick. But I says, I _got_ to do it--I can\\'t get _out_ of it. Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns, and they stopped and I stopped. One of them says: \"What\\'s that yonder?\" \"A piece of a raft,\" I says. \"Do you belong on it?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Any men on it?\" \"Only one, sir.\" \"Well, there\\'s five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above the head of the bend. Is your man white or black?\" I didn\\'t answer up prompt. I tried to, but the words wouldn\\'t come. I tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn\\'t man enough--hadn\\'t the spunk of a rabbit. I see I was weakening; so I just give up trying, and up and says: \"He\\'s white.\" \"I reckon we\\'ll go and see for ourselves.\" \"I wish you would,\" says I, \"because it\\'s pap that\\'s there, and maybe you\\'d help me tow the raft ashore where the light is. He\\'s sick--and so is mam and Mary Ann.\" \"Oh, the devil! we\\'re in a hurry, boy. But I s\\'pose we\\'ve got to. Come, buckle to your paddle, and let\\'s get along.\" I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars. When we had made a stroke or two, I says: \"Pap\\'ll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you. Everybody goes away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can\\'t do it by myself.\" \"Well, that\\'s infernal mean. Odd, too. Say, boy, what\\'s the matter with your father?\" \"It\\'s the--a--the--well, it ain\\'t anything much.\" They stopped pulling. It warn\\'t but a mighty little ways to the raft now. One says: \"Boy, that\\'s a lie. What _is_ the matter with your pap? Answer up square now, and it\\'ll be the better for you.\" \"I will, sir, I will, honest--but don\\'t leave us, please. It\\'s the--the--Gentlemen, if you\\'ll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the headline, you won\\'t have to come a-near the raft--please do.\" \"Set her back, John, set her back!\" says one. They backed water. \"Keep away, boy--keep to looard. Confound it, I just expect the wind has blowed it to us. Your pap\\'s got the small-pox, and you know it precious well. Why didn\\'t you come out and say so? Do you want to spread it all over?\" \"Well,\" says I, a-blubbering, \"I\\'ve told everybody before, and they just went away and left us.\" \"Poor devil, there\\'s something in that. We are right down sorry for you, but we--well, hang it, we don\\'t want the small-pox, you see. Look here, I\\'ll tell you what to do. Don\\'t you try to land by yourself, or you\\'ll smash everything to pieces. You float along down about twenty miles, and you\\'ll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river. It will be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever. Don\\'t be a fool again, and let people guess what is the matter. Now we\\'re trying to do you a kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that\\'s a good boy. It wouldn\\'t do any good to land yonder where the light is--it\\'s only a wood-yard. Say, I reckon your father\\'s poor, and I\\'m bound to say he\\'s in pretty hard luck. Here, I\\'ll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this board, and you get it when it floats by. I feel mighty mean to leave you; but my kingdom! it won\\'t do to fool with small-pox, don\\'t you see?\" \"Hold on, Parker,\" says the other man, \"here\\'s a twenty to put on the board for me. Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you\\'ll be all right.\" \"That\\'s so, my boy--good-bye, good-bye. If you see any runaway niggers you get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it.\" \"Good-bye, sir,\" says I; \"I won\\'t let no runaway niggers get by me if I can help it.\" They went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because I knowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn\\'t no use for me to try to learn to do right; a body that don\\'t get _started_ right when he\\'s little ain\\'t got no show--when the pinch comes there ain\\'t nothing to back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat. Then I thought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s\\'pose you\\'d a done right and give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now? No, says I, I\\'d feel bad--I\\'d feel just the same way I do now. Well, then, says I, what\\'s the use you learning to do right when it\\'s troublesome to do right and ain\\'t no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same? I was stuck. I couldn\\'t answer that. So I reckoned I wouldn\\'t bother no more about it, but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time. I went into the wigwam; Jim warn\\'t there. I looked all around; he warn\\'t anywhere. I says: \"Jim!\" \"Here I is, Huck. Is dey out o\\' sight yit? Don\\'t talk loud.\" He was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out. I told him they were out of sight, so he come aboard. He says: \"I was a-listenin\\' to all de talk, en I slips into de river en was gwyne to shove for sho\\' if dey come aboard. Den I was gwyne to swim to de raf\\' agin when dey was gone. But lawsy, how you did fool \\'em, Huck! Dat _wuz_ de smartes\\' dodge! I tell you, chile, I\\'spec it save\\' ole Jim--ole Jim ain\\'t going to forgit you for dat, honey.\" Then we talked about the money. It was a pretty good raise--twenty dollars apiece. Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free States. He said twenty mile more warn\\'t far for the raft to go, but he wished we was already there. Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding the raft good. Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and getting all ready to quit rafting. That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in a left-hand bend. I went off in the canoe to ask about it. Pretty soon I found a man out in the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line. I ranged up and says: \"Mister, is that town Cairo?\" \"Cairo? no. You must be a blame\\' fool.\" \"What town is it, mister?\" \"If you want to know, go and find out. If you stay here botherin\\' around me for about a half a minute longer you\\'ll get something you won\\'t want.\" I paddled to the raft. Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never mind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned. We passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but it was high ground, so I didn\\'t go. No high ground about Cairo, Jim said. I had forgot it. We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable close to the left-hand bank. I begun to suspicion something. So did Jim. I says: \"Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.\" He says: \"Doan\\' le\\'s talk about it, Huck. Po\\' niggers can\\'t have no luck. I awluz \\'spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn\\'t done wid its work.\" \"I wish I\\'d never seen that snake-skin, Jim--I do wish I\\'d never laid eyes on it.\" \"It ain\\'t yo\\' fault, Huck; you didn\\' know. Don\\'t you blame yo\\'self \\'bout it.\" When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure enough, and outside was the old regular Muddy! So it was all up with Cairo. We talked it all over. It wouldn\\'t do to take to the shore; we couldn\\'t take the raft up the stream, of course. There warn\\'t no way but to wait for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances. So we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work, and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone! We didn\\'t say a word for a good while. There warn\\'t anything to say. We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it? It would only look like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more bad luck--and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep still. By and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn\\'t no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in. We warn\\'t going to borrow it when there warn\\'t anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after us. So we shoved out after dark on the raft. Anybody that don\\'t believe yet that it\\'s foolishness to handle a snake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe it now if they read on and see what more it done for us. The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore. But we didn\\'t see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and more. Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next meanest thing to fog. You can\\'t tell the shape of the river, and you can\\'t see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along comes a steamboat up the river. We lit the lantern, and judged she would see it. Up-stream boats didn\\'t generly come close to us; they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river. We could hear her pounding along, but we didn\\'t see her good till she was close. She aimed right for us. Often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks he\\'s mighty smart. Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to try and shave us; but she didn\\'t seem to be sheering off a bit. She was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us. There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam--and as Jim went overboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight through the raft. I dived--and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel had got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room. I could always stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a minute and a half. Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was nearly busting. I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose, and puffed a bit. Of course there was a booming current; and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I could hear her. I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn\\'t get any answer; so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was \"treading water,\" and struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me. But I made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way. It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good long time in getting over. I made a safe landing, and clumb up the bank. I couldn\\'t see but a little ways, but I went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a big old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it. I was going to rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg. ',\n",
              " 'XVII. IN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head out, and says: \"Be done, boys! Who\\'s there?\" I says: \"It\\'s me.\" \"Who\\'s me?\" \"George Jackson, sir.\" \"What do you want?\" \"I don\\'t want nothing, sir. I only want to go along by, but the dogs won\\'t let me.\" \"What are you prowling around here this time of night for--hey?\" \"I warn\\'t prowling around, sir, I fell overboard off of the steamboat.\" \"Oh, you did, did you? Strike a light there, somebody. What did you say your name was?\" \"George Jackson, sir. I\\'m only a boy.\" \"Look here, if you\\'re telling the truth you needn\\'t be afraid--nobody\\'ll hurt you. But don\\'t try to budge; stand right where you are. Rouse out Bob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns. George Jackson, is there anybody with you?\" \"No, sir, nobody.\" I heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light. The man sung out: \"Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool--ain\\'t you got any sense? Put it on the floor behind the front door. Bob, if you and Tom are ready, take your places.\" \"All ready.\" \"Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?\" \"No, sir; I never heard of them.\" \"Well, that may be so, and it mayn\\'t. Now, all ready. Step forward, George Jackson. And mind, don\\'t you hurry--come mighty slow. If there\\'s anybody with you, let him keep back--if he shows himself he\\'ll be shot. Come along now. Come slow; push the door open yourself--just enough to squeeze in, d\\' you hear?\" I didn\\'t hurry; I couldn\\'t if I\\'d a wanted to. I took one slow step at a time and there warn\\'t a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart. The dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little behind me. When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting. I put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said, \"There, that\\'s enough--put your head in.\" I done it, but I judged they would take it off. The candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, and me at them, for about a quarter of a minute: Three big men with guns pointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray and about sixty, the other two thirty or more--all of them fine and handsome--and the sweetest old gray-headed lady, and back of her two young women which I couldn\\'t see right well. The old gentleman says: \"There; I reckon it\\'s all right. Come in.\" As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor, and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windows--there warn\\'t none on the side. They held the candle, and took a good look at me, and all said, \"Why, _he_ ain\\'t a Shepherdson--no, there ain\\'t any Shepherdson about him.\" Then the old man said he hoped I wouldn\\'t mind being searched for arms, because he didn\\'t mean no harm by it--it was only to make sure. So he didn\\'t pry into my pockets, but only felt outside with his hands, and said it was all right. He told me to make myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but the old lady says: \"Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing\\'s as wet as he can be; and don\\'t you reckon it may be he\\'s hungry?\" \"True for you, Rachel--I forgot.\" So the old lady says: \"Betsy\" (this was a nigger woman), \"you fly around and get him something to eat as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you girls go and wake up Buck and tell him--oh, here he is himself. Buck, take this little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some of yours that\\'s dry.\" Buck looked about as old as me--thirteen or fourteen or along there, though he was a little bigger than me. He hadn\\'t on anything but a shirt, and he was very frowzy-headed. He came in gaping and digging one fist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the other one. He says: \"Ain\\'t they no Shepherdsons around?\" They said, no, \\'twas a false alarm. \"Well,\" he says, \"if they\\'d a ben some, I reckon I\\'d a got one.\" They all laughed, and Bob says: \"Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you\\'ve been so slow in coming.\" \"Well, nobody come after me, and it ain\\'t right I\\'m always kept down; I don\\'t get no show.\" \"Never mind, Buck, my boy,\" says the old man, \"you\\'ll have show enough, all in good time, don\\'t you fret about that. Go \\'long with you now, and do as your mother told you.\" When we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a roundabout and pants of his, and I put them on. While I was at it he asked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he started to tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day before yesterday, and he asked me where Moses was when the candle went out. I said I didn\\'t know; I hadn\\'t heard about it before, no way. \"Well, guess,\" he says. \"How\\'m I going to guess,\" says I, \"when I never heard tell of it before?\" \"But you can guess, can\\'t you? It\\'s just as easy.\" \"_Which_ candle?\" I says. \"Why, any candle,\" he says. \"I don\\'t know where he was,\" says I; \"where was he?\" \"Why, he was in the _dark_! That\\'s where he was!\" \"Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?\" \"Why, blame it, it\\'s a riddle, don\\'t you see? Say, how long are you going to stay here? You got to stay always. We can just have booming times--they don\\'t have no school now. Do you own a dog? I\\'ve got a dog--and he\\'ll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in. Do you like to comb up Sundays, and all that kind of foolishness? You bet I don\\'t, but ma she makes me. Confound these ole britches! I reckon I\\'d better put \\'em on, but I\\'d ruther not, it\\'s so warm. Are you all ready? All right. Come along, old hoss.\" Cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk--that is what they had for me down there, and there ain\\'t nothing better that ever I\\'ve come across yet. Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes, except the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women. They all smoked and talked, and I eat and talked. The young women had quilts around them, and their hair down their backs. They all asked me questions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went to hunt them and he warn\\'t heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died, and then there warn\\'t nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died I took what there was left, because the farm didn\\'t belong to us, and started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how I come to be here. So they said I could have a home there as long as I wanted it. Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all, I had forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an hour trying to think, and when Buck waked up I says: \"Can you spell, Buck?\" \"Yes,\" he says. \"I bet you can\\'t spell my name,\" says I. \"I bet you what you dare I can,\" says he. \"All right,\" says I, \"go ahead.\" \"G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n--there now,\" he says. \"Well,\" says I, \"you done it, but I didn\\'t think you could. It ain\\'t no slouch of a name to spell--right off without studying.\" I set it down, private, because somebody might want _me_ to spell it next, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was used to it. It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too. I hadn\\'t seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style. It didn\\'t have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in town. There warn\\'t no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them. There was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown, same as they do in town. They had big brass dog-irons that could hold up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it. It was beautiful to hear that clock tick; and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out. They wouldn\\'t took any money for her. Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock, made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy. By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other; and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn\\'t open their mouths nor look different nor interested. They squeaked through underneath. There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those things. On the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is, but they warn\\'t real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it was, underneath. This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around. It come all the way from Philadelphia, they said. There was some books, too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table. One was a big family Bible full of pictures. One was Pilgrim\\'s Progress, about a man that left his family, it didn\\'t say why. I read considerable in it now and then. The statements was interesting, but tough. Another was Friendship\\'s Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn\\'t read the poetry. Another was Henry Clay\\'s Speeches, and another was Dr. Gunn\\'s Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead. There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books. And there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not bagged down in the middle and busted, like an old basket. They had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called \"Signing the Declaration.\" There was some that they called crayons, which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old. They was different from any pictures I ever see before--blacker, mostly, than is common. One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the picture it said \"Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.\" Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath the picture it said \"I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.\" There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath the picture it said \"And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.\" These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn\\'t somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the fan-tods. Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost. But I reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard. She was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done, but she never got the chance. It was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up towards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it. Other times it was hid with a little curtain. The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me. This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head. It was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded: ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC\\'D And did young Stephen sicken, And did young Stephen die? And did the sad hearts thicken, And did the mourners cry? No; such was not the fate of Young Stephen Dowling Bots; Though sad hearts round him thickened, \\'Twas not from sickness\\' shots. No whooping-cough did rack his frame, Nor measles drear with spots; Not these impaired the sacred name Of Stephen Dowling Bots. Despised love struck not with woe That head of curly knots, Nor stomach troubles laid him low, Young Stephen Dowling Bots. O no. Then list with tearful eye, Whilst I his fate do tell. His soul did from this cold world fly By falling down a well. They got him out and emptied him; Alas it was too late; His spirit was gone for to sport aloft In the realms of the good and great. If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen, there ain\\'t no telling what she could a done by and by. Buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing. She didn\\'t ever have to stop to think. He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn\\'t find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one, and go ahead. She warn\\'t particular; she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful. Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on hand with her \"tribute\" before he was cold. She called them tributes. The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the undertaker--the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person\\'s name, which was Whistler. She warn\\'t ever the same after that; she never complained, but she kinder pined away and did not live long. Poor thing, many\\'s the time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on her a little. I liked all that family, dead ones and all, and warn\\'t going to let anything come between us. Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive, and it didn\\'t seem right that there warn\\'t nobody to make some about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself, but I couldn\\'t seem to make it go somehow. They kept Emmeline\\'s room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there. The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty of niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there mostly. Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on the windows: white, with pictures painted on them of castles with vines all down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink. There was a little old piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing \"The Last Link is Broken\" and play \"The Battle of Prague\" on it. The walls of all the rooms was plastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside. It was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day, and it was a cool, comfortable place. Nothing couldn\\'t be better. And warn\\'t the cooking good, and just bushels of it too! ',\n",
              " 'XVIII. COL. Grangerford was a gentleman, you see. He was a gentleman all over; and so was his family. He was well born, as the saying is, and that\\'s worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn\\'t no more quality than a mudcat himself. Col. Grangerford was very tall and very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you, as you may say. His forehead was high, and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it. He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn\\'t no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn\\'t ever loud. He was as kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know, and so you had confidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was afterwards. He didn\\'t ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was always good-mannered where he was. Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most always--I mean he made it seem like good weather. When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn\\'t nothing go wrong again for a week. When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn\\'t set down again till they had set down. Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom\\'s and Bob\\'s was mixed, and then they bowed and said, \"Our duty to you, sir, and madam;\" and _they_ bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank, all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too. Bob was the oldest and Tom next--tall, beautiful men with very broad shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes. They dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and wore broad Panama hats. Then there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud and grand, but as good as she could be when she warn\\'t stirred up; but when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks, like her father. She was beautiful. So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind. She was gentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty. Each person had their own nigger to wait on them--Buck too. My nigger had a monstrous easy time, because I warn\\'t used to having anybody do anything for me, but Buck\\'s was on the jump most of the time. This was all there was of the family now, but there used to be more--three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died. The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers. Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods daytimes, and balls at the house nights. These people was mostly kinfolks of the family. The men brought their guns with them. It was a handsome lot of quality, I tell you. There was another clan of aristocracy around there--five or six families--mostly of the name of Shepherdson. They was as high-toned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords. The Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing, which was about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with a lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their fine horses. One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse coming. We was crossing the road. Buck says: \"Quick! Jump for the woods!\" We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves. Pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier. He had his gun across his pommel. I had seen him before. It was young Harney Shepherdson. I heard Buck\\'s gun go off at my ear, and Harney\\'s hat tumbled off from his head. He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid. But we didn\\'t wait. We started through the woods on a run. The woods warn\\'t thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet, and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away the way he come--to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn\\'t see. We never stopped running till we got home. The old gentleman\\'s eyes blazed a minute--\\'twas pleasure, mainly, I judged--then his face sort of smoothed down, and he says, kind of gentle: \"I don\\'t like that shooting from behind a bush. Why didn\\'t you step into the road, my boy?\" \"The Shepherdsons don\\'t, father. They always take advantage.\" Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling his tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped. The two young men looked dark, but never said nothing. Miss Sophia she turned pale, but the color come back when she found the man warn\\'t hurt. Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by ourselves, I says: \"Did you want to kill him, Buck?\" \"Well, I bet I did.\" \"What did he do to you?\" \"Him? He never done nothing to me.\" \"Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?\" \"Why, nothing--only it\\'s on account of the feud.\" \"What\\'s a feud?\" \"Why, where was you raised? Don\\'t you know what a feud is?\" \"Never heard of it before--tell me about it.\" \"Well,\" says Buck, \"a feud is this way: A man has a quarrel with another man, and kills him; then that other man\\'s brother kills _him_; then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the _cousins_ chip in--and by and by everybody\\'s killed off, and there ain\\'t no more feud. But it\\'s kind of slow, and takes a long time.\" \"Has this one been going on long, Buck?\" \"Well, I should _reckon_! It started thirty year ago, or som\\'ers along there. There was trouble \\'bout something, and then a lawsuit to settle it; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot the man that won the suit--which he would naturally do, of course. Anybody would.\" \"What was the trouble about, Buck?--land?\" \"I reckon maybe--I don\\'t know.\" \"Well, who done the shooting? Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?\" \"Laws, how do I know? It was so long ago.\" \"Don\\'t anybody know?\" \"Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but they don\\'t know now what the row was about in the first place.\" \"Has there been many killed, Buck?\" \"Yes; right smart chance of funerals. But they don\\'t always kill. Pa\\'s got a few buckshot in him; but he don\\'t mind it \\'cuz he don\\'t weigh much, anyway. Bob\\'s been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom\\'s been hurt once or twice.\" \"Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?\" \"Yes; we got one and they got one. \\'Bout three months ago my cousin Bud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on t\\'other side of the river, and didn\\'t have no weapon with him, which was blame\\' foolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind him, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin\\' after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and \\'stead of jumping off and taking to the brush, Bud \\'lowed he could out-run him; so they had it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining all the time; so at last Bud seen it warn\\'t any use, so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the old man he rode up and shot him down. But he didn\\'t git much chance to enjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid _him_ out.\" \"I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.\" \"I reckon he _warn\\'t_ a coward. Not by a blame\\' sight. There ain\\'t a coward amongst them Shepherdsons--not a one. And there ain\\'t no cowards amongst the Grangerfords either. Why, that old man kep\\' up his end in a fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come out winner. They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile, and kep\\' his horse before him to stop the bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them. Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the Grangerfords had to be _fetched_ home--and one of \\'em was dead, and another died the next day. No, sir; if a body\\'s out hunting for cowards he don\\'t want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuz they don\\'t breed any of that _kind_.\" Next Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody a-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall. The Shepherdsons done the same. It was pretty ornery preaching--all about brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and preforeordestination, and I don\\'t know what all, that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet. About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull. Buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep. I went up to our room, and judged I would take a nap myself. I found that sweet Miss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her, and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and not tell anybody, and I said I would. Then she said she\\'d forgot her Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books, and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say nothing to nobody. I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the road, and there warn\\'t anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two, for there warn\\'t any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summer-time because it\\'s cool. If you notice, most folks don\\'t go to church only when they\\'ve got to; but a hog is different. Says I to myself, something\\'s up; it ain\\'t natural for a girl to be in such a sweat about a Testament. So I give it a shake, and out drops a little piece of paper with \"HALF-PAST TWO\" wrote on it with a pencil. I ransacked it, but couldn\\'t find anything else. I couldn\\'t make anything out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me. She pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody. She was mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it made her powerful pretty. I was a good deal astonished, but when I got my breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I had read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing, and I told her \"no, only coarse-hand,\" and then she said the paper warn\\'t anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and play now. I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon I noticed that my nigger was following along behind. When we was out of sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes a-running, and says: \"Mars Jawge, if you\\'ll come down into de swamp I\\'ll show you a whole stack o\\' water-moccasins.\" Thinks I, that\\'s mighty curious; he said that yesterday. He oughter know a body don\\'t love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for them. What is he up to, anyway? So I says: \"All right; trot ahead.\" I followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded ankle deep as much as another half-mile. We come to a little flat piece of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines, and he says: \"You shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah\\'s whah dey is. I\\'s seed \\'m befo\\'; I don\\'t k\\'yer to see \\'em no mo\\'.\" Then he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid him. I poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man laying there asleep--and, by jings, it was my old Jim! I waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him to see me again, but it warn\\'t. He nearly cried he was so glad, but he warn\\'t surprised. Said he swum along behind me that night, and heard me yell every time, but dasn\\'t answer, because he didn\\'t want nobody to pick _him_ up and take him into slavery again. Says he: \"I got hurt a little, en couldn\\'t swim fas\\', so I wuz a considable ways behine you towards de las\\'; when you landed I reck\\'ned I could ketch up wid you on de lan\\' \\'dout havin\\' to shout at you, but when I see dat house I begin to go slow. I \\'uz off too fur to hear what dey say to you--I wuz \\'fraid o\\' de dogs; but when it \\'uz all quiet agin I knowed you\\'s in de house, so I struck out for de woods to wait for day. Early in de mawnin\\' some er de niggers come along, gwyne to de fields, en dey tuk me en showed me dis place, whah de dogs can\\'t track me on accounts o\\' de water, en dey brings me truck to eat every night, en tells me how you\\'s a-gitt\\'n along.\" \"Why didn\\'t you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner, Jim?\" \"Well, \\'twarn\\'t no use to \\'sturb you, Huck, tell we could do sumfn--but we\\'s all right now. I ben a-buyin\\' pots en pans en vittles, as I got a chanst, en a-patchin\\' up de raf\\' nights when--\" \"_What_ raft, Jim?\" \"Our ole raf\\'.\" \"You mean to say our old raft warn\\'t smashed all to flinders?\" \"No, she warn\\'t. She was tore up a good deal--one en\\' of her was; but dey warn\\'t no great harm done, on\\'y our traps was mos\\' all los\\'. Ef we hadn\\' dive\\' so deep en swum so fur under water, en de night hadn\\' ben so dark, en we warn\\'t so sk\\'yerd, en ben sich punkin-heads, as de sayin\\' is, we\\'d a seed de raf\\'. But it\\'s jis\\' as well we didn\\'t, \\'kase now she\\'s all fixed up agin mos\\' as good as new, en we\\'s got a new lot o\\' stuff, in de place o\\' what \\'uz los\\'.\" \"Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim--did you catch her?\" \"How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods? No; some er de niggers foun\\' her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben\\', en dey hid her in a crick \\'mongst de willows, en dey wuz so much jawin\\' \\'bout which un \\'um she b\\'long to de mos\\' dat I come to heah \\'bout it pooty soon, so I ups en settles de trouble by tellin\\' \\'um she don\\'t b\\'long to none uv um, but to you en me; en I ast \\'m if dey gwyne to grab a young white genlman\\'s propaty, en git a hid\\'n for it? Den I gin \\'m ten cents apiece, en dey \\'uz mighty well satisfied, en wisht some mo\\' raf\\'s \\'ud come along en make \\'m rich agin. Dey\\'s mighty good to me, dese niggers is, en whatever I wants \\'m to do fur me I doan\\' have to ast \\'m twice, honey. Dat Jack\\'s a good nigger, en pooty smart.\" \"Yes, he is. He ain\\'t ever told me you was here; told me to come, and he\\'d show me a lot of water-moccasins. If anything happens _he_ ain\\'t mixed up in it. He can say he never seen us together, and it \\'ll be the truth.\" I don\\'t want to talk much about the next day. I reckon I\\'ll cut it pretty short. I waked up about dawn, and was a-going to turn over and go to sleep again when I noticed how still it was--didn\\'t seem to be anybody stirring. That warn\\'t usual. Next I noticed that Buck was up and gone. Well, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes down stairs--nobody around; everything as still as a mouse. Just the same outside. Thinks I, what does it mean? Down by the wood-pile I comes across my Jack, and says: \"What\\'s it all about?\" Says he: \"Don\\'t you know, Mars Jawge?\" \"No,\" says I, \"I don\\'t.\" \"Well, den, Miss Sophia\\'s run off! \\'deed she has. She run off in de night some time--nobody don\\'t know jis\\' when; run off to get married to dat young Harney Shepherdson, you know--leastways, so dey \\'spec. De fambly foun\\' it out \\'bout half an hour ago--maybe a little mo\\'--en\\' I _tell_ you dey warn\\'t no time los\\'. Sich another hurryin\\' up guns en hosses _you_ never see! De women folks has gone for to stir up de relations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up de river road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him \\'fo\\' he kin git acrost de river wid Miss Sophia. I reck\\'n dey\\'s gwyne to be mighty rough times.\" \"Buck went off \\'thout waking me up.\" \"Well, I reck\\'n he _did_! Dey warn\\'t gwyne to mix you up in it. Mars Buck he loaded up his gun en \\'lowed he\\'s gwyne to fetch home a Shepherdson or bust. Well, dey\\'ll be plenty un \\'m dah, I reck\\'n, en you bet you he\\'ll fetch one ef he gits a chanst.\" I took up the river road as hard as I could put. By and by I begin to hear guns a good ways off. When I come in sight of the log store and the woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees and brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched. There was a wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn\\'t. There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open place before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the steamboat landing; but they couldn\\'t come it. Every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at. The two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could watch both ways. By and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling. They started riding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady bead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle. All the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the run. They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed. Then the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after them. They gained on the boys, but it didn\\'t do no good, the boys had too good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree, and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again. One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen years old. The men ripped around awhile, and then rode away. As soon as they was out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him. He didn\\'t know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first. He was awful surprised. He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or other--wouldn\\'t be gone long. I wished I was out of that tree, but I dasn\\'t come down. Buck begun to cry and rip, and \\'lowed that him and his cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this day yet. He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two or three of the enemy. Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush. Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relations--the Shepherdsons was too strong for them. I asked him what was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia. He said they\\'d got across the river and was safe. I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take on because he didn\\'t manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him--I hain\\'t ever heard anything like it. All of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns--the men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses! The boys jumped for the river--both of them hurt--and as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out, \"Kill them, kill them!\" It made me so sick I most fell out of the tree. I ain\\'t a-going to tell _all_ that happened--it would make me sick again if I was to do that. I wished I hadn\\'t ever come ashore that night to see such things. I ain\\'t ever going to get shut of them--lots of times I dream about them. I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down. Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the trouble was still a-going on. I was mighty downhearted; so I made up my mind I wouldn\\'t ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I was to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; and I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and this awful mess wouldn\\'t ever happened. When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a piece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and tugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces, and got away as quick as I could. I cried a little when I was covering up Buck\\'s face, for he was mighty good to me. It was just dark now. I never went near the house, but struck through the woods and made for the swamp. Jim warn\\'t on his island, so I tramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows, red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country. The raft was gone! My souls, but I was scared! I couldn\\'t get my breath for most a minute. Then I raised a yell. A voice not twenty-five foot from me says: \"Good lan\\'! is dat you, honey? Doan\\' make no noise.\" It was Jim\\'s voice--nothing ever sounded so good before. I run along the bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he was so glad to see me. He says: \"Laws bless you, chile, I \\'uz right down sho\\' you\\'s dead agin. Jack\\'s been heah; he say he reck\\'n you\\'s ben shot, kase you didn\\' come home no mo\\'; so I\\'s jes\\' dis minute a startin\\' de raf\\' down towards de mouf er de crick, so\\'s to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack comes agin en tells me for certain you _is_ dead. Lawsy, I\\'s mighty glad to git you back again, honey.\" I says: \"All right--that\\'s mighty good; they won\\'t find me, and they\\'ll think I\\'ve been killed, and floated down the river--there\\'s something up there that \\'ll help them think so--so don\\'t you lose no time, Jim, but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.\" I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the Mississippi. Then we hung up our signal lantern, and judged that we was free and safe once more. I hadn\\'t had a bite to eat since yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk, and pork and cabbage and greens--there ain\\'t nothing in the world so good when it\\'s cooked right--and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a good time. I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so was Jim to get away from the swamp. We said there warn\\'t no home like a raft, after all. Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a raft don\\'t. You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft. ',\n",
              " 'XIX. TWO or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by, they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely. Here is the way we put in the time. It was a monstrous big river down there--sometimes a mile and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly always in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and willows, and hid the raft with them. Then we set out the lines. Next we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep, and watched the daylight come. Not a sound anywheres--perfectly still--just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs a-cluttering, maybe. The first thing to see, looking away over the water, was a kind of dull line--that was the woods on t\\'other side; you couldn\\'t make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and warn\\'t black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots drifting along ever so far away--trading scows, and such things; and long black streaks--rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there\\'s a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t\\'other side of the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way, because they\\'ve left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they do get pretty rank; and next you\\'ve got the full day, and everything smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it! A little smoke couldn\\'t be noticed now, so we would take some fish off of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast. And afterwards we would watch the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by lazy off to sleep. Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the other side you couldn\\'t tell nothing about her only whether she was a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn\\'t be nothing to hear nor nothing to see--just solid lonesomeness. Next you\\'d see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it chopping, because they\\'re most always doing it on a raft; you\\'d see the axe flash and come down--you don\\'t hear nothing; you see that axe go up again, and by the time it\\'s above the man\\'s head then you hear the _k\\'chunk_!--it had took all that time to come over the water. So we would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness. Once there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldn\\'t run over them. A scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughing--heard them plain; but we couldn\\'t see no sign of them; it made you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air. Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says: \"No; spirits wouldn\\'t say, \\'Dern the dern fog.\\'\" Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and talked about all kinds of things--we was always naked, day and night, whenever the mosquitoes would let us--the new clothes Buck\\'s folks made for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn\\'t go much on clothes, nohow. Sometimes we\\'d have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe a spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts. It\\'s lovely to live on a raft. We had the sky up there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened. Jim he allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would have took too long to _make_ so many. Jim said the moon could a _laid_ them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn\\'t say nothing against it, because I\\'ve seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them streak down. Jim allowed they\\'d got spoiled and was hove out of the nest. Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the raft a bit, and after that you wouldn\\'t hear nothing for you couldn\\'t tell how long, except maybe frogs or something. After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or three hours the shores was black--no more sparks in the cabin windows. These sparks was our clock--the first one that showed again meant morning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away. One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the main shore--it was only two hundred yards--and paddled about a mile up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn\\'t get some berries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they could foot it. I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was after anybody I judged it was _me_--or maybe Jim. I was about to dig out from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sung out and begged me to save their lives--said they hadn\\'t been doing nothing, and was being chased for it--said there was men and dogs a-coming. They wanted to jump right in, but I says: \"Don\\'t you do it. I don\\'t hear the dogs and horses yet; you\\'ve got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; then you take to the water and wade down to me and get in--that\\'ll throw the dogs off the scent.\" They done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead, and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off, shouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn\\'t see them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we got further and further away all the time, we couldn\\'t hardly hear them at all; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the river, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in the cottonwoods and was safe. One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head and very gray whiskers. He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and a greasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses--no, he only had one. He had an old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm, and both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags. The other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery. After breakfast we all laid off and talked, and the first thing that come out was that these chaps didn\\'t know one another. \"What got you into trouble?\" says the baldhead to t\\'other chap. \"Well, I\\'d been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth--and it does take it off, too, and generly the enamel along with it--but I stayed about one night longer than I ought to, and was just in the act of sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town, and you told me they were coming, and begged me to help you to get off. So I told you I was expecting trouble myself, and would scatter out _with_ you. That\\'s the whole yarn--what\\'s yourn? \"Well, I\\'d ben a-running\\' a little temperance revival thar \\'bout a week, and was the pet of the women folks, big and little, for I was makin\\' it mighty warm for the rummies, I _tell_ you, and takin\\' as much as five or six dollars a night--ten cents a head, children and niggers free--and business a-growin\\' all the time, when somehow or another a little report got around last night that I had a way of puttin\\' in my time with a private jug on the sly. A nigger rousted me out this mornin\\', and told me the people was getherin\\' on the quiet with their dogs and horses, and they\\'d be along pretty soon and give me \\'bout half an hour\\'s start, and then run me down if they could; and if they got me they\\'d tar and feather me and ride me on a rail, sure. I didn\\'t wait for no breakfast--I warn\\'t hungry.\" \"Old man,\" said the young one, \"I reckon we might double-team it together; what do you think?\" \"I ain\\'t undisposed. What\\'s your line--mainly?\" \"Jour printer by trade; do a little in patent medicines; theater-actor--tragedy, you know; take a turn to mesmerism and phrenology when there\\'s a chance; teach singing-geography school for a change; sling a lecture sometimes--oh, I do lots of things--most anything that comes handy, so it ain\\'t work. What\\'s your lay?\" \"I\\'ve done considerble in the doctoring way in my time. Layin\\' on o\\' hands is my best holt--for cancer and paralysis, and sich things; and I k\\'n tell a fortune pretty good when I\\'ve got somebody along to find out the facts for me. Preachin\\'s my line, too, and workin\\' camp-meetin\\'s, and missionaryin\\' around.\" Nobody never said anything for a while; then the young man hove a sigh and says: \"Alas!\" \"What \\'re you alassin\\' about?\" says the bald-head. \"To think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and be degraded down into such company.\" And he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag. \"Dern your skin, ain\\'t the company good enough for you?\" says the baldhead, pretty pert and uppish. \"Yes, it _is_ good enough for me; it\\'s as good as I deserve; for who fetched me so low when I was so high? I did myself. I don\\'t blame _you_, gentlemen--far from it; I don\\'t blame anybody. I deserve it all. Let the cold world do its worst; one thing I know--there\\'s a grave somewhere for me. The world may go on just as it\\'s always done, and take everything from me--loved ones, property, everything; but it can\\'t take that. Some day I\\'ll lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken heart will be at rest.\" He went on a-wiping. \"Drot your pore broken heart,\" says the baldhead; \"what are you heaving your pore broken heart at _us_ f\\'r? _we_ hain\\'t done nothing.\" \"No, I know you haven\\'t. I ain\\'t blaming you, gentlemen. I brought myself down--yes, I did it myself. It\\'s right I should suffer--perfectly right--I don\\'t make any moan.\" \"Brought you down from whar? Whar was you brought down from?\" \"Ah, you would not believe me; the world never believes--let it pass--\\'tis no matter. The secret of my birth--\" \"The secret of your birth! Do you mean to say--\" \"Gentlemen,\" says the young man, very solemn, \"I will reveal it to you, for I feel I may have confidence in you. By rights I am a duke!\" Jim\\'s eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too. Then the baldhead says: \"No! you can\\'t mean it?\" \"Yes. My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fled to this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the pure air of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his own father dying about the same time. The second son of the late duke seized the titles and estates--the infant real duke was ignored. I am the lineal descendant of that infant--I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater; and here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of men, despised by the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft!\" Jim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but he said it warn\\'t much use, he couldn\\'t be much comforted; said if we was a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most anything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how. He said we ought to bow when we spoke to him, and say \"Your Grace,\" or \"My Lord,\" or \"Your Lordship\"--and he wouldn\\'t mind it if we called him plain \"Bridgewater,\" which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for him he wanted done. Well, that was all easy, so we done it. All through dinner Jim stood around and waited on him, and says, \"Will yo\\' Grace have some o\\' dis or some o\\' dat?\" and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him. But the old man got pretty silent by and by--didn\\'t have much to say, and didn\\'t look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on around that duke. He seemed to have something on his mind. So, along in the afternoon, he says: \"Looky here, Bilgewater,\" he says, \"I\\'m nation sorry for you, but you ain\\'t the only person that\\'s had troubles like that.\" \"No?\" \"No you ain\\'t. You ain\\'t the only person that\\'s ben snaked down wrongfully out\\'n a high place.\" \"Alas!\" \"No, you ain\\'t the only person that\\'s had a secret of his birth.\" And, by jings, _he_ begins to cry. \"Hold! What do you mean?\" \"Bilgewater, kin I trust you?\" says the old man, still sort of sobbing. \"To the bitter death!\" He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it, and says, \"That secret of your being: speak!\" \"Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!\" You bet you, Jim and me stared this time. Then the duke says: \"You are what?\" \"Yes, my friend, it is too true--your eyes is lookin\\' at this very moment on the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the Sixteen and Marry Antonette.\" \"You! At your age! No! You mean you\\'re the late Charlemagne; you must be six or seven hundred years old, at the very least.\" \"Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude. Yes, gentlemen, you see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin\\', exiled, trampled-on, and sufferin\\' rightful King of France.\" Well, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn\\'t know hardly what to do, we was so sorry--and so glad and proud we\\'d got him with us, too. So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort _him_. But he said it warn\\'t no use, nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him \"Your Majesty,\" and waited on him first at meals, and didn\\'t set down in his presence till he asked them. So Jim and me set to majestying him, and doing this and that and t\\'other for him, and standing up till he told us we might set down. This done him heaps of good, and so he got cheerful and comfortable. But the duke kind of soured on him, and didn\\'t look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still, the king acted real friendly towards him, and said the duke\\'s great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good deal thought of by _his_ father, and was allowed to come to the palace considerable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, till by and by the king says: \"Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer raft, Bilgewater, and so what\\'s the use o\\' your bein\\' sour? It \\'ll only make things oncomfortable. It ain\\'t my fault I warn\\'t born a duke, it ain\\'t your fault you warn\\'t born a king--so what\\'s the use to worry? Make the best o\\' things the way you find \\'em, says I--that\\'s my motto. This ain\\'t no bad thing that we\\'ve struck here--plenty grub and an easy life--come, give us your hand, duke, and le\\'s all be friends.\" The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it. It took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft; for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody to be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others. It didn\\'t take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn\\'t no kings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds. But I never said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it\\'s the best way; then you don\\'t have no quarrels, and don\\'t get into no trouble. If they wanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn\\'t no objections, \\'long as it would keep peace in the family; and it warn\\'t no use to tell Jim, so I didn\\'t tell him. If I never learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way. ',\n",
              " 'XX. THEY asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we covered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of running--was Jim a runaway nigger? Says I: \"Goodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run _south_?\" No, they allowed he wouldn\\'t. I had to account for things some way, so I says: \"My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike. Pa, he \\'lowed he\\'d break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who\\'s got a little one-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans. Pa was pretty poor, and had some debts; so when he\\'d squared up there warn\\'t nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim. That warn\\'t enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way. Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we\\'d go down to Orleans on it. Pa\\'s luck didn\\'t hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel; Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four years old, so they never come up no more. Well, for the next day or two we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was a runaway nigger. We don\\'t run daytimes no more now; nights they don\\'t bother us.\" The duke says: \"Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we want to. I\\'ll think the thing over--I\\'ll invent a plan that\\'ll fix it. We\\'ll let it alone for to-day, because of course we don\\'t want to go by that town yonder in daylight--it mightn\\'t be healthy.\" Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat lightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was beginning to shiver--it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see that. So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see what the beds was like. My bed was a straw tick better than Jim\\'s, which was a corn-shuck tick; there\\'s always cobs around about in a shuck tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it makes such a rustling that you wake up. Well, the duke allowed he would take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn\\'t. He says: \"I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that a corn-shuck bed warn\\'t just fitten for me to sleep on. Your Grace \\'ll take the shuck bed yourself.\" Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was going to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when the duke says: \"\\'Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of oppression. Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I submit; \\'tis my fate. I am alone in the world--let me suffer; can bear it.\" We got away as soon as it was good and dark. The king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town. We come in sight of the little bunch of lights by and by--that was the town, you know--and slid by, about a half a mile out, all right. When we was three-quarters of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o\\'clock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night. It was my watch below till twelve, but I wouldn\\'t a turned in anyway if I\\'d had a bed, because a body don\\'t see such a storm as that every day in the week, not by a long sight. My souls, how the wind did scream along! And every second or two there\\'d come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around, and you\\'d see the islands looking dusty through the rain, and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!--bum! bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum--and the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away, and quit--and then RIP comes another flash and another sockdolager. The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes, but I hadn\\'t any clothes on, and didn\\'t mind. We didn\\'t have no trouble about snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them. I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time, so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always mighty good that way, Jim was. I crawled into the wigwam, but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn\\'t no show for me; so I laid outside--I didn\\'t mind the rain, because it was warm, and the waves warn\\'t running so high now. About two they come up again, though, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because he reckoned they warn\\'t high enough yet to do any harm; but he was mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard. It most killed Jim a-laughing. He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway. I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by the storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed I rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day. The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him and the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game. Then they got tired of it, and allowed they would \"lay out a campaign,\" as they called it. The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read them out loud. One bill said, \"The celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris,\" would \"lecture on the Science of Phrenology\" at such and such a place, on the blank day of blank, at ten cents admission, and \"furnish charts of character at twenty-five cents apiece.\" The duke said that was _him_. In another bill he was the \"world-renowned Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick the Younger, of Drury Lane, London.\" In other bills he had a lot of other names and done other wonderful things, like finding water and gold with a \"divining-rod,\" \"dissipating witch spells,\" and so on. By and by he says: \"But the histrionic muse is the darling. Have you ever trod the boards, Royalty?\" \"No,\" says the king. \"You shall, then, before you\\'re three days older, Fallen Grandeur,\" says the duke. \"The first good town we come to we\\'ll hire a hall and do the sword fight in Richard III. and the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet. How does that strike you?\" \"I\\'m in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater; but, you see, I don\\'t know nothing about play-actin\\', and hain\\'t ever seen much of it. I was too small when pap used to have \\'em at the palace. Do you reckon you can learn me?\" \"Easy!\" \"All right. I\\'m jist a-freezn\\' for something fresh, anyway. Le\\'s commence right away.\" So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, and said he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet. \"But if Juliet\\'s such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my white whiskers is goin\\' to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.\" \"No, don\\'t you worry; these country jakes won\\'t ever think of that. Besides, you know, you\\'ll be in costume, and that makes all the difference in the world; Juliet\\'s in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight before she goes to bed, and she\\'s got on her night-gown and her ruffled nightcap. Here are the costumes for the parts.\" He got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was meedyevil armor for Richard III. and t\\'other chap, and a long white cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match. The king was satisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same time, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the king and told him to get his part by heart. There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would go down to the town and fix that thing. The king allowed he would go, too, and see if he couldn\\'t strike something. We was out of coffee, so Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some. When we got there there warn\\'t nobody stirring; streets empty, and perfectly dead and still, like Sunday. We found a sick nigger sunning himself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn\\'t too young or too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in the woods. The king got the directions, and allowed he\\'d go and work that camp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too. The duke said what he was after was a printing-office. We found it; a little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop--carpenters and printers all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked. It was a dirty, littered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures of horses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls. The duke shed his coat and said he was all right now. So me and the king lit out for the camp-meeting. We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a most awful hot day. There was as much as a thousand people there from twenty mile around. The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched everywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep off the flies. There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of watermelons and green corn and such-like truck. The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was bigger and held crowds of people. The benches was made out of outside slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs. They didn\\'t have no backs. The preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds. The women had on sun-bonnets; and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the young ones had on calico. Some of the young men was barefooted, and some of the children didn\\'t have on any clothes but just a tow-linen shirt. Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks was courting on the sly. The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn. He lined out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it, there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then he lined out two more for them to sing--and so on. The people woke up more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some begun to groan, and some begun to shout. Then the preacher begun to preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and that, shouting, \"It\\'s the brazen serpent in the wilderness! Look upon it and live!\" And people would shout out, \"Glory!--A-a-_men_!\" And so he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen: \"Oh, come to the mourners\\' bench! come, black with sin! (_Amen_!) come, sick and sore! (_Amen_!) come, lame and halt and blind! (_Amen_!) come, pore and needy, sunk in shame! (_A-A-Men_!) come, all that\\'s worn and soiled and suffering!--come with a broken spirit! come with a contrite heart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse is free, the door of heaven stands open--oh, enter in and be at rest!\" (_A-A-Men_! _Glory, Glory Hallelujah!_) And so on. You couldn\\'t make out what the preacher said any more, on account of the shouting and crying. Folks got up everywheres in the crowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners\\' bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild. Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him over everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, and the preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it. He told them he was a pirate--been a pirate for thirty years out in the Indian Ocean--and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in a fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to goodness he\\'d been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat without a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing that ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy for the first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to start right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he could do it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate crews in that ocean; and though it would take him a long time to get there without money, he would get there anyway, and every time he convinced a pirate he would say to him, \"Don\\'t you thank me, don\\'t you give me no credit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting, natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that dear preacher there, the truest friend a pirate ever had!\" And then he busted into tears, and so did everybody. Then somebody sings out, \"Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!\" Well, a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, \"Let _him_ pass the hat around!\" Then everybody said it, the preacher too. So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes, and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the prettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and he always done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six times--and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to live in their houses, and said they\\'d think it was an honor; but he said as this was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn\\'t do no good, and besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to work on the pirates. When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents. And then he had fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a wagon when he was starting home through the woods. The king said, take it all around, it laid over any day he\\'d ever put in in the missionarying line. He said it warn\\'t no use talking, heathens don\\'t amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with. The duke was thinking _he\\'d_ been doing pretty well till the king come to show up, but after that he didn\\'t think so so much. He had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printing-office--horse bills--and took the money, four dollars. And he had got in ten dollars\\' worth of advertisements for the paper, which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance--so they done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash. He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of his own head--three verses--kind of sweet and saddish--the name of it was, \"Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart\"--and he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper, and didn\\'t charge nothing for it. Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he\\'d done a pretty square day\\'s work for it. Then he showed us another little job he\\'d printed and hadn\\'t charged for, because it was for us. It had a picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and \"$200 reward\" under it. The reading was all about Jim, and just described him to a dot. It said he run away from St. Jacques\\' plantation, forty mile below New Orleans, last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send him back he could have the reward and expenses. \"Now,\" says the duke, \"after to-night we can run in the daytime if we want to. Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat, so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward. Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim, but it wouldn\\'t go well with the story of us being so poor. Too much like jewelry. Ropes are the correct thing--we must preserve the unities, as we say on the boards.\" We all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn\\'t be no trouble about running daytimes. We judged we could make miles enough that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke\\'s work in the printing office was going to make in that little town; then we could boom right along if we wanted to. We laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten o\\'clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn\\'t hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it. When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says: \"Huck, does you reck\\'n we gwyne to run acrost any mo\\' kings on dis trip?\" \"No,\" I says, \"I reckon not.\" \"Well,\" says he, \"dat\\'s all right, den. I doan\\' mine one er two kings, but dat\\'s enough. Dis one\\'s powerful drunk, en de duke ain\\' much better.\" I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he could hear what it was like; but he said he had been in this country so long, and had so much trouble, he\\'d forgot it. ',\n",
              " 'XXI. IT was after sun-up now, but we went right on and didn\\'t tie up. The king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty; but after they\\'d jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good deal. After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft, and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches, and let his legs dangle in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe, and went to getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart. When he had got it pretty good him and the duke begun to practice it together. The duke had to learn him over and over again how to say every speech; and he made him sigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after a while he said he done it pretty well; \"only,\" he says, \"you mustn\\'t bellow out _Romeo_! that way, like a bull--you must say it soft and sick and languishy, so--R-o-o-meo! that is the idea; for Juliet\\'s a dear sweet mere child of a girl, you know, and she doesn\\'t bray like a jackass.\" Well, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of oak laths, and begun to practice the sword fight--the duke called himself Richard III.; and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft was grand to see. But by and by the king tripped and fell overboard, and after that they took a rest, and had a talk about all kinds of adventures they\\'d had in other times along the river. After dinner the duke says: \"Well, Capet, we\\'ll want to make this a first-class show, you know, so I guess we\\'ll add a little more to it. We want a little something to answer encores with, anyway.\" \"What\\'s onkores, Bilgewater?\" The duke told him, and then says: \"I\\'ll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor\\'s hornpipe; and you--well, let me see--oh, I\\'ve got it--you can do Hamlet\\'s soliloquy.\" \"Hamlet\\'s which?\" \"Hamlet\\'s soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in Shakespeare. Ah, it\\'s sublime, sublime! Always fetches the house. I haven\\'t got it in the book--I\\'ve only got one volume--but I reckon I can piece it out from memory. I\\'ll just walk up and down a minute, and see if I can call it back from recollection\\'s vaults.\" So he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning horrible every now and then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows; next he would squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan; next he would sigh, and next he\\'d let on to drop a tear. It was beautiful to see him. By and by he got it. He told us to give attention. Then he strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his arms stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky; and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after that, all through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and swelled up his chest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before. This is the speech--I learned it, easy enough, while he was learning it to the king: To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity of so long life; For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come to Dunsinane, But that the fear of something after death Murders the innocent sleep, Great nature\\'s second course, And makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not of. There\\'s the respect must give us pause: Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor\\'s wrong, the proud man\\'s contumely, The law\\'s delay, and the quietus which his pangs might take. In the dead waste and middle of the night, when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black, But that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns, Breathes forth contagion on the world, And thus the native hue of resolution, like the poor cat i\\' the adage, Is sicklied o\\'er with care. And all the clouds that lowered o\\'er our housetops, With this regard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action. \\'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished. But soft you, the fair Ophelia: Ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws. But get thee to a nunnery&mdash;go! Well, the old man he liked that speech, and he mighty soon got it so he could do it first rate. It seemed like he was just born for it; and when he had his hand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovely the way he would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off. The first chance we got, the duke he had some show bills printed; and after that, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was a most uncommon lively place, for there warn\\'t nothing but sword-fighting and rehearsing--as the duke called it--going on all the time. One morning, when we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw, we come in sight of a little one-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up about three-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of a crick which was shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us but Jim took the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for our show. We struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there that afternoon, and the country people was already beginning to come in, in all kinds of old shackly wagons, and on horses. The circus would leave before night, so our show would have a pretty good chance. The duke he hired the court house, and we went around and stuck up our bills. They read like this: Shaksperean Revival!!! Wonderful Attraction! For One Night Only!

The stores and houses was most all old shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn\\'t ever been painted; they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses had little gardens around them, but they didn\\'t seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled-up boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out tin-ware. The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on at different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that didn\\'t generly have but one hinge--a leather one. Some of the fences had been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in Clumbus\\'s time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the garden, and people driving them out. All the stores was along one street. They had white domestic awnings in front, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts. There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting on them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and chawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching--a mighty ornery lot. They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella, but didn\\'t wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill, and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and used considerable many cuss words. There was as many as one loafer leaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his hands in his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch. What a body was hearing amongst them all the time was: \"Gimme a chaw \\'v tobacker, Hank.\" \"Cain\\'t; I hain\\'t got but one chaw left. Ask Bill.\" Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain\\'t got none. Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a chaw of tobacco of their own. They get all their chawing by borrowing; they say to a fellow, \"I wisht you\\'d len\\' me a chaw, Jack, I jist this minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had\"--which is a lie pretty much everytime; it don\\'t fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain\\'t no stranger, so he says: \"_You_ give him a chaw, did you? So did your sister\\'s cat\\'s grandmother. You pay me back the chaws you\\'ve awready borry\\'d off\\'n me, Lafe Buckner, then I\\'ll loan you one or two ton of it, and won\\'t charge you no back intrust, nuther.\" \"Well, I _did_ pay you back some of it wunst.\" \"Yes, you did--\\'bout six chaws. You borry\\'d store tobacker and paid back nigger-head.\" Store tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted. When they borrow a chaw they don\\'t generly cut it off with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it\\'s handed back, and says, sarcastic: \"Here, gimme the _chaw_, and you take the _plug_.\" All the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn\\'t nothing else _but_ mud--mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places, and two or three inches deep in _all_ the places. The hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres. You\\'d see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way, where folks had to walk around her, and she\\'d stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as happy as if she was on salary. And pretty soon you\\'d hear a loafer sing out, \"Hi! _so_ boy! sick him, Tige!\" and away the sow would go, squealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, and three or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise. Then they\\'d settle back again till there was a dog fight. There couldn\\'t anything wake them up all over, and make them happy all over, like a dog fight--unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death. On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank, and they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in. The people had moved out of them. The bank was caved away under one corner of some others, and that corner was hanging over. People lived in them yet, but it was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time. Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving back, and back, and back, because the river\\'s always gnawing at it. The nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons and horses in the streets, and more coming all the time. Families fetched their dinners with them from the country, and eat them in the wagons. There was considerable whisky drinking going on, and I seen three fights. By and by somebody sings out: \"Here comes old Boggs!--in from the country for his little old monthly drunk; here he comes, boys!\" All the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having fun out of Boggs. One of them says: \"Wonder who he\\'s a-gwyne to chaw up this time. If he\\'d a-chawed up all the men he\\'s ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he\\'d have considerable ruputation now.\" Another one says, \"I wisht old Boggs \\'d threaten me, \\'cuz then I\\'d know I warn\\'t gwyne to die for a thousan\\' year.\" Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling like an Injun, and singing out: \"Cler the track, thar. I\\'m on the waw-path, and the price uv coffins is a-gwyne to raise.\" He was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty year old, and had a very red face. Everybody yelled at him and laughed at him and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he\\'d attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns, but he couldn\\'t wait now because he\\'d come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his motto was, \"Meat first, and spoon vittles to top off on.\" He see me, and rode up and says: \"Whar\\'d you come f\\'m, boy? You prepared to die?\" Then he rode on. I was scared, but a man says: \"He don\\'t mean nothing; he\\'s always a-carryin\\' on like that when he\\'s drunk. He\\'s the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw--never hurt nobody, drunk nor sober.\" Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells: \"Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you\\'ve swindled. You\\'re the houn\\' I\\'m after, and I\\'m a-gwyne to have you, too!\" And so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to, and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going on. By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five--and he was a heap the best dressed man in that town, too--steps out of the store, and the crowd drops back on each side to let him come. He says to Boggs, mighty ca\\'m and slow--he says: \"I\\'m tired of this, but I\\'ll endure it till one o\\'clock. Till one o\\'clock, mind--no longer. If you open your mouth against me only once after that time you can\\'t travel so far but I will find you.\" Then he turns and goes in. The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody stirred, and there warn\\'t no more laughing. Boggs rode off blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street; and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping it up. Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up, but he wouldn\\'t; they told him it would be one o\\'clock in about fifteen minutes, and so he _must_ go home--he must go right away. But it didn\\'t do no good. He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down the street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober; but it warn\\'t no use--up the street he would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing. By and by somebody says: \"Go for his daughter!--quick, go for his daughter; sometimes he\\'ll listen to her. If anybody can persuade him, she can.\" So somebody started on a run. I walked down street a ways and stopped. In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but not on his horse. He was a-reeling across the street towards me, bare-headed, with a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along. He was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn\\'t hanging back any, but was doing some of the hurrying himself. Somebody sings out: \"Boggs!\" I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel Sherburn. He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a pistol raised in his right hand--not aiming it, but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky. The same second I see a young girl coming on the run, and two men with her. Boggs and the men turned round to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to a level--both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and says, \"O Lord, don\\'t shoot!\" Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers back, clawing at the air--bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles backwards on to the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out. That young girl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her father, crying, and saying, \"Oh, he\\'s killed him, he\\'s killed him!\" The crowd closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, with their necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting, \"Back, back! give him air, give him air!\" Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground, and turned around on his heels and walked off. They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just the same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good place at the window, where I was close to him and could see in. They laid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and opened another one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirt first, and I seen where one of the bullets went in. He made about a dozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his breath, and letting it down again when he breathed it out--and after that he laid still; he was dead. Then they pulled his daughter away from him, screaming and crying, and took her off. She was about sixteen, and very sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared. Well, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people that had the places wouldn\\'t give them up, and folks behind them was saying all the time, \"Say, now, you\\'ve looked enough, you fellows; \\'tain\\'t right and \\'tain\\'t fair for you to stay thar all the time, and never give nobody a chance; other folks has their rights as well as you.\" There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe there was going to be trouble. The streets was full, and everybody was excited. Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened, and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows, stretching their necks and listening. One long, lanky man, with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a crooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs stood and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from one place to t\\'other and watching everything he done, and bobbing their heads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had stood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung out, \"Boggs!\" and then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says \"Bang!\" staggered backwards, says \"Bang!\" again, and fell down flat on his back. The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect; said it was just exactly the way it all happened. Then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him. Well, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched. In about a minute everybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, and snatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with. ',\n",
              " 'XXII. THEY swarmed up towards Sherburn\\'s house, a-whooping and raging like Injuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush, and it was awful to see. Children was heeling it ahead of the mob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along the road was full of women\\'s heads, and there was nigger boys in every tree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as the mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of reach. Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scared most to death. They swarmed up in front of Sherburn\\'s palings as thick as they could jam together, and you couldn\\'t hear yourself think for the noise. It was a little twenty-foot yard. Some sung out \"Tear down the fence! tear down the fence!\" Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave. Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch, with a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly ca\\'m and deliberate, not saying a word. The racket stopped, and the wave sucked back. Sherburn never said a word--just stood there, looking down. The stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable. Sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out-gaze him, but they couldn\\'t; they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant kind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that\\'s got sand in it. Then he says, slow and scornful: \"The idea of _you_ lynching anybody! It\\'s amusing. The idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a _man_! Because you\\'re brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along here, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a _man_? Why, a _man\\'s_ safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind--as long as it\\'s daytime and you\\'re not behind him. \"Do I know you? I know you clear through. I was born and raised in the South, and I\\'ve lived in the North; so I know the average all around. The average man\\'s a coward. In the North he lets anybody walk over him that wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it. In the South one man all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime, and robbed the lot. Your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other people--whereas you\\'re just _as_ brave, and no braver. Why don\\'t your juries hang murderers? Because they\\'re afraid the man\\'s friends will shoot them in the back, in the dark--and it\\'s just what they _would_ do. \"So they always acquit; and then a _man_ goes in the night, with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal. Your mistake is, that you didn\\'t bring a man with you; that\\'s one mistake, and the other is that you didn\\'t come in the dark and fetch your masks. You brought _part_ of a man--Buck Harkness, there--and if you hadn\\'t had him to start you, you\\'d a taken it out in blowing. \"You didn\\'t want to come. The average man don\\'t like trouble and danger. _You_ don\\'t like trouble and danger. But if only _half_ a man--like Buck Harkness, there--shouts \\'Lynch him! lynch him!\\' you\\'re afraid to back down--afraid you\\'ll be found out to be what you are--_cowards_--and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that half-a-man\\'s coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big things you\\'re going to do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that\\'s what an army is--a mob; they don\\'t fight with courage that\\'s born in them, but with courage that\\'s borrowed from their mass, and from their officers. But a mob without any _man_ at the head of it is _beneath_ pitifulness. Now the thing for _you_ to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole. If any real lynching\\'s going to be done it will be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they\\'ll bring their masks, and fetch a _man_ along. Now _leave_--and take your half-a-man with you\"--tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this. The crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearing off every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking tolerable cheap. I could a stayed if I wanted to, but I didn\\'t want to. I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by, and then dived in under the tent. I had my twenty-dollar gold piece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because there ain\\'t no telling how soon you are going to need it, away from home and amongst strangers that way. You can\\'t be too careful. I ain\\'t opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain\\'t no other way, but there ain\\'t no use in _wasting_ it on them. It was a real bully circus. It was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side by side, the men just in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes nor stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable--there must a been twenty of them--and every lady with a lovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang of real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars, and just littered with diamonds. It was a powerful fine sight; I never see anything so lovely. And then one by one they got up and stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their heads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and every lady\\'s rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips, and she looking like the most loveliest parasol. And then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one foot out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and more, and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole, cracking his whip and shouting \"Hi!--hi!\" and the clown cracking jokes behind him; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves! And so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I ever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild. Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people. The ringmaster couldn\\'t ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever _could_ think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I couldn\\'t noway understand. Why, I couldn\\'t a thought of them in a year. And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring--said he wanted to ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was. They argued and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn\\'t listen, and the whole show come to a standstill. Then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, \"Knock him down! throw him out!\" and one or two women begun to scream. So, then, the ringmaster he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn\\'t be no disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn\\'t make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse. So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around, with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down. And at last, sure enough, all the circus men could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation, round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side, and then t\\'other one on t\\'other side, and the people just crazy. It warn\\'t funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger. But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire too. He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warn\\'t ever drunk in his life--and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them. He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum--and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment. Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he _was_ the sickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon. Why, it was one of his own men! He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on to nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn\\'t a been in that ringmaster\\'s place, not for a thousand dollars. I don\\'t know; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but I never struck them yet. Anyways, it was plenty good enough for _me_; and wherever I run across it, it can have all of _my_ custom every time. Well, that night we had _our_ show; but there warn\\'t only about twelve people there--just enough to pay expenses. And they laughed all the time, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before the show was over, but one boy which was asleep. So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads couldn\\'t come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted was low comedy--and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he reckoned. He said he could size their style. So next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off some handbills, and stuck them up all over the village. The bills said: ',\n",
              " 'XXIII. WELL, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house was jam full of men in no time. When the place couldn\\'t hold no more, the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech, and praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about Edmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it; and at last when he\\'d got everybody\\'s expectations up high enough, he rolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king come a-prancing out on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over, ring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a rainbow. And--but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild, but it was awful funny. The people most killed themselves laughing; and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, they roared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done it over again, and after that they made him do it another time. Well, it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut. Then the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts of pressing London engagements, where the seats is all sold already for it in Drury Lane; and then he makes them another bow, and says if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he will be deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and see it. Twenty people sings out: \"What, is it over? Is that _all_?\" The duke says yes. Then there was a fine time. Everybody sings out, \"Sold!\" and rose up mad, and was a-going for that stage and them tragedians. But a big, fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts: \"Hold on! Just a word, gentlemen.\" They stopped to listen. \"We are sold--mighty badly sold. But we don\\'t want to be the laughing stock of this whole town, I reckon, and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live. _No_. What we want is to go out of here quiet, and talk this show up, and sell the _rest_ of the town! Then we\\'ll all be in the same boat. Ain\\'t that sensible?\" (\"You bet it is!--the jedge is right!\" everybody sings out.) \"All right, then--not a word about any sell. Go along home, and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy.\" Next day you couldn\\'t hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was. House was jammed again that night, and we sold this crowd the same way. When me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all had a supper; and by and by, about midnight, they made Jim and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river, and fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town. The third night the house was crammed again--and they warn\\'t new-comers this time, but people that was at the show the other two nights. I stood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his coat--and I see it warn\\'t no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight. I smelt sickly eggs by the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and such things; and if I know the signs of a dead cat being around, and I bet I do, there was sixty-four of them went in. I shoved in there for a minute, but it was too various for me; I couldn\\'t stand it. Well, when the place couldn\\'t hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute, and then he started around for the stage door, I after him; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says: \"Walk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you!\" I done it, and he done the same. We struck the raft at the same time, and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream, all dark and still, and edging towards the middle of the river, nobody saying a word. I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam, and says: \"Well, how\\'d the old thing pan out this time, duke?\" He hadn\\'t been up-town at all. We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village. Then we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they\\'d served them people. The duke says: \"Greenhorns, flatheads! I knew the first house would keep mum and let the rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they\\'d lay for us the third night, and consider it was _their_ turn now. Well, it _is_ their turn, and I\\'d give something to know how much they\\'d take for it. I _would_ just like to know how they\\'re putting in their opportunity. They can turn it into a picnic if they want to--they brought plenty provisions.\" Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that three nights. I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that before. By and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says: \"Don\\'t it s\\'prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?\" \"No,\" I says, \"it don\\'t.\" \"Why don\\'t it, Huck?\" \"Well, it don\\'t, because it\\'s in the breed. I reckon they\\'re all alike.\" \"But, Huck, dese kings o\\' ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat\\'s jist what dey is; dey\\'s reglar rapscallions.\" \"Well, that\\'s what I\\'m a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as fur as I can make out.\" \"Is dat so?\" \"You read about them once--you\\'ll see. Look at Henry the Eight; this \\'n \\'s a Sunday-school Superintendent to _him_. And look at Charles Second, and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain. My, you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom. He _was_ a blossom. He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning. And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs. \\'Fetch up Nell Gwynn,\\' he says. They fetch her up. Next morning, \\'Chop off her head!\\' And they chop it off. \\'Fetch up Jane Shore,\\' he says; and up she comes, Next morning, \\'Chop off her head\\'--and they chop it off. \\'Ring up Fair Rosamun.\\' Fair Rosamun answers the bell. Next morning, \\'Chop off her head.\\' And he made every one of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it Domesday Book--which was a good name and stated the case. You don\\'t know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest I\\'ve struck in history. Well, Henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How does he go at it--give notice?--give the country a show? No. All of a sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on. That was _his_ style--he never give anybody a chance. He had suspicions of his father, the Duke of Wellington. Well, what did he do? Ask him to show up? No--drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat. S\\'pose people left money laying around where he was--what did he do? He collared it. S\\'pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn\\'t set down there and see that he done it--what did he do? He always done the other thing. S\\'pose he opened his mouth--what then? If he didn\\'t shut it up powerful quick he\\'d lose a lie every time. That\\'s the kind of a bug Henry was; and if we\\'d a had him along \\'stead of our kings he\\'d a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done. I don\\'t say that ourn is lambs, because they ain\\'t, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they ain\\'t nothing to _that_ old ram, anyway. All I say is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances. Take them all around, they\\'re a mighty ornery lot. It\\'s the way they\\'re raised.\" \"But dis one do _smell_ so like de nation, Huck.\" \"Well, they all do, Jim. We can\\'t help the way a king smells; history don\\'t tell no way.\" \"Now de duke, he\\'s a tolerble likely man in some ways.\" \"Yes, a duke\\'s different. But not very different. This one\\'s a middling hard lot for a duke. When he\\'s drunk there ain\\'t no near-sighted man could tell him from a king.\" \"Well, anyways, I doan\\' hanker for no mo\\' un um, Huck. Dese is all I kin stan\\'.\" \"It\\'s the way I feel, too, Jim. But we\\'ve got them on our hands, and we got to remember what they are, and make allowances. Sometimes I wish we could hear of a country that\\'s out of kings.\" What was the use to tell Jim these warn\\'t real kings and dukes? It wouldn\\'t a done no good; and, besides, it was just as I said: you couldn\\'t tell them from the real kind. I went to sleep, and Jim didn\\'t call me when it was my turn. He often done that. When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself. I didn\\'t take notice nor let on. I knowed what it was about. He was thinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was low and homesick; because he hadn\\'t ever been away from home before in his life; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their\\'n. It don\\'t seem natural, but I reckon it\\'s so. He was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he judged I was asleep, and saying, \"Po\\' little \\'Lizabeth! po\\' little Johnny! it\\'s mighty hard; I spec\\' I ain\\'t ever gwyne to see you no mo\\', no mo\\'!\" He was a mighty good nigger, Jim was. But this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young ones; and by and by he says: \"What makes me feel so bad dis time \\'uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder on de bank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it mine me er de time I treat my little \\'Lizabeth so ornery. She warn\\'t on\\'y \\'bout fo\\' year ole, en she tuck de sk\\'yarlet fever, en had a powful rough spell; but she got well, en one day she was a-stannin\\' aroun\\', en I says to her, I says: \"\\'Shet de do\\'.\\' \"She never done it; jis\\' stood dah, kiner smilin\\' up at me. It make me mad; en I says agin, mighty loud, I says: \"\\'Doan\\' you hear me? Shet de do\\'!\\' \"She jis stood de same way, kiner smilin\\' up. I was a-bilin\\'! I says: \"\\'I lay I _make_ you mine!\\' \"En wid dat I fetch\\' her a slap side de head dat sont her a-sprawlin\\'. Den I went into de yuther room, en \\'uz gone \\'bout ten minutes; en when I come back dah was dat do\\' a-stannin\\' open _yit_, en dat chile stannin\\' mos\\' right in it, a-lookin\\' down and mournin\\', en de tears runnin\\' down. My, but I _wuz_ mad! I was a-gwyne for de chile, but jis\\' den--it was a do\\' dat open innerds--jis\\' den, \\'long come de wind en slam it to, behine de chile, ker-BLAM!--en my lan\\', de chile never move\\'! My breff mos\\' hop outer me; en I feel so--so--I doan\\' know HOW I feel. I crope out, all a-tremblin\\', en crope aroun\\' en open de do\\' easy en slow, en poke my head in behine de chile, sof\\' en still, en all uv a sudden I says POW! jis\\' as loud as I could yell. _She never budge!_ Oh, Huck, I bust out a-cryin\\' en grab her up in my arms, en say, \\'Oh, de po\\' little thing! De Lord God Amighty fogive po\\' ole Jim, kaze he never gwyne to fogive hisself as long\\'s he live!\\' Oh, she was plumb deef en dumb, Huck, plumb deef en dumb--en I\\'d ben a-treat\\'n her so!\" ',\n",
              " 'XXIV. NEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns. Jim he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn\\'t take but a few hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope. You see, when we left him all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it wouldn\\'t look much like he was a runaway nigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay roped all day, and he\\'d cipher out some way to get around it. He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. He dressed Jim up in King Lear\\'s outfit--it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint and painted Jim\\'s face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead, dull, solid blue, like a man that\\'s been drownded nine days. Blamed if he warn\\'t the horriblest looking outrage I ever see. Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so: Sick Arab--but harmless when not out of his head. And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam. Jim was satisfied. He said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all over every time there was a sound. The duke told him to make himself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone. Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he wouldn\\'t wait for him to howl. Why, he didn\\'t only look like he was dead, he looked considerable more than that. These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn\\'t be safe, because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time. They couldn\\'t hit no project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he\\'d lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn\\'t put up something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop over to t\\'other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence to lead him the profitable way--meaning the devil, I reckon. We had all bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his\\'n on, and he told me to put mine on. I done it, of course. The king\\'s duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy. I never knowed how clothes could change a body before. Why, before, he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he\\'d take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand and good and pious that you\\'d say he had walked right out of the ark, and maybe was old Leviticus himself. Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I got my paddle ready. There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point, about three mile above the town--been there a couple of hours, taking on freight. Says the king: \"Seein\\' how I\\'m dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St. Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big place. Go for the steamboat, Huckleberry; we\\'ll come down to the village on her.\" I didn\\'t have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride. I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water. Pretty soon we come to a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a couple of big carpet-bags by him. \"Run her nose in shore,\" says the king. I done it. \"Wher\\' you bound for, young man?\" \"For the steamboat; going to Orleans.\" \"Git aboard,\" says the king. \"Hold on a minute, my servant \\'ll he\\'p you with them bags. Jump out and he\\'p the gentleman, Adolphus\"--meaning me, I see. I done so, and then we all three started on again. The young chap was mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather. He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he\\'d come down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there. The young fellow says: \"When I first see you I says to myself, \\'It\\'s Mr. Wilks, sure, and he come mighty near getting here in time.\\' But then I says again, \\'No, I reckon it ain\\'t him, or else he wouldn\\'t be paddling up the river.\\' You _ain\\'t_ him, are you?\" \"No, my name\\'s Blodgett--Elexander Blodgett--_Reverend_ Elexander Blodgett, I s\\'pose I must say, as I\\'m one o\\' the Lord\\'s poor servants. But still I\\'m jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving in time, all the same, if he\\'s missed anything by it--which I hope he hasn\\'t.\" \"Well, he don\\'t miss any property by it, because he\\'ll get that all right; but he\\'s missed seeing his brother Peter die--which he mayn\\'t mind, nobody can tell as to that--but his brother would a give anything in this world to see _him_ before he died; never talked about nothing else all these three weeks; hadn\\'t seen him since they was boys together--and hadn\\'t ever seen his brother William at all--that\\'s the deef and dumb one--William ain\\'t more than thirty or thirty-five. Peter and George were the only ones that come out here; George was the married brother; him and his wife both died last year. Harvey and William\\'s the only ones that\\'s left now; and, as I was saying, they haven\\'t got here in time.\" \"Did anybody send \\'em word?\" \"Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter said then that he sorter felt like he warn\\'t going to get well this time. You see, he was pretty old, and George\\'s g\\'yirls was too young to be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn\\'t seem to care much to live. He most desperately wanted to see Harvey--and William, too, for that matter--because he was one of them kind that can\\'t bear to make a will. He left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he\\'d told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so George\\'s g\\'yirls would be all right--for George didn\\'t leave nothing. And that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to.\" \"Why do you reckon Harvey don\\'t come? Wher\\' does he live?\" \"Oh, he lives in England--Sheffield--preaches there--hasn\\'t ever been in this country. He hasn\\'t had any too much time--and besides he mightn\\'t a got the letter at all, you know.\" \"Too bad, too bad he couldn\\'t a lived to see his brothers, poor soul. You going to Orleans, you say?\" \"Yes, but that ain\\'t only a part of it. I\\'m going in a ship, next Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.\" \"It\\'s a pretty long journey. But it\\'ll be lovely; wisht I was a-going. Is Mary Jane the oldest? How old is the others?\" \"Mary Jane\\'s nineteen, Susan\\'s fifteen, and Joanna\\'s about fourteen--that\\'s the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare-lip.\" \"Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.\" \"Well, they could be worse off. Old Peter had friends, and they ain\\'t going to let them come to no harm. There\\'s Hobson, the Babtis\\' preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley, and--well, there\\'s a lot of them; but these are the ones that Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when he wrote home; so Harvey \\'ll know where to look for friends when he gets here.\" Well, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow. Blamed if he didn\\'t inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about Peter\\'s business--which was a tanner; and about George\\'s--which was a carpenter; and about Harvey\\'s--which was a dissentering minister; and so on, and so on. Then he says: \"What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?\" \"Because she\\'s a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn\\'t stop there. When they\\'re deep they won\\'t stop for a hail. A Cincinnati boat will, but this is a St. Louis one.\" \"Was Peter Wilks well off?\" \"Oh, yes, pretty well off. He had houses and land, and it\\'s reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som\\'ers.\" \"When did you say he died?\" \"I didn\\'t say, but it was last night.\" \"Funeral to-morrow, likely?\" \"Yes, \\'bout the middle of the day.\" \"Well, it\\'s all terrible sad; but we\\'ve all got to go, one time or another. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we\\'re all right.\" \"Yes, sir, it\\'s the best way. Ma used to always say that.\" When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she got off. The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost my ride, after all. When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says: \"Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new carpet-bags. And if he\\'s gone over to t\\'other side, go over there and git him. And tell him to git himself up regardless. Shove along, now.\" I see what _he_ was up to; but I never said nothing, of course. When I got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a log, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had said it--every last word of it. And all the time he was a-doing it he tried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for a slouch. I can\\'t imitate him, and so I ain\\'t a-going to try to; but he really done it pretty good. Then he says: \"How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?\" The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef and dumb person on the histronic boards. So then they waited for a steamboat. About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along, but they didn\\'t come from high enough up the river; but at last there was a big one, and they hailed her. She sent out her yawl, and we went aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and said they wouldn\\'t land us. But the king was ca\\'m. He says: \"If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry \\'em, can\\'t it?\" So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the village they yawled us ashore. About two dozen men flocked down when they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says: \"Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher\\' Mr. Peter Wilks lives?\" they give a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say, \"What d\\' I tell you?\" Then one of them says, kind of soft and gentle: \"I\\'m sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he _did_ live yesterday evening.\" Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his back, and says: \"Alas, alas, our poor brother--gone, and we never got to see him; oh, it\\'s too, too hard!\" Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn\\'t drop a carpet-bag and bust out a-crying. If they warn\\'t the beatenest lot, them two frauds, that ever I struck. Well, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all sorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hill for them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about his brother\\'s last moments, and the king he told it all over again on his hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner like they\\'d lost the twelve disciples. Well, if ever I struck anything like it, I\\'m a nigger. It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race. ',\n",
              " 'XXV. THE news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the people tearing down on the run from every which way, some of them putting on their coats as they come. Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd, and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march. The windows and dooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over a fence: \"Is it _them_?\" And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say: \"You bet it is.\" When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the three girls was standing in the door. Mary Jane _was_ red-headed, but that don\\'t make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her face and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncles was come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped for them, and the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they had it! Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have such good times. Then the king he hunched the duke private--I see him do it--and then he looked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs; so then him and the duke, with a hand across each other\\'s shoulder, and t\\'other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there, everybody dropping back to give them room, and all the talk and noise stopping, people saying \"Sh!\" and all the men taking their hats off and drooping their heads, so you could a heard a pin fall. And when they got there they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one sight, and then they bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to Orleans, most; and then they put their arms around each other\\'s necks, and hung their chins over each other\\'s shoulders; and then for three minutes, or maybe four, I never see two men leak the way they done. And, mind you, everybody was doing the same; and the place was that damp I never see anything like it. Then one of them got on one side of the coffin, and t\\'other on t\\'other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin, and let on to pray all to themselves. Well, when it come to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it, and everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud--the poor girls, too; and every woman, nearly, went up to the girls, without saying a word, and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put their hand on their head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears running down, and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give the next woman a show. I never see anything so disgusting. Well, by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, and works himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four thousand mile, but it\\'s a trial that\\'s sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so he thanks them out of his heart and out of his brother\\'s heart, because out of their mouths they can\\'t, words being too weak and cold, and all that kind of rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and then he blubbers out a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust. And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their might, and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out. Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and hogwash I never see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and bully. Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up with the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying yonder could speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that was very dear to him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he will name the same, to wit, as follows, vizz.:--Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley. Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting together--that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t\\'other world, and the preacher was pinting him right. Lawyer Bell was away up to Louisville on business. But the rest was on hand, and so they all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him; and then they shook hands with the duke and didn\\'t say nothing, but just kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said \"Goo-goo--goo-goo-goo\" all the time, like a baby that can\\'t talk. So the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty much everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts of little things that happened one time or another in the town, or to George\\'s family, or to Peter. And he always let on that Peter wrote him the things; but that was a lie: he got every blessed one of them out of that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat. Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the king he read it out loud and cried over it. It give the dwelling-house and three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard (which was doing a good business), along with some other houses and land (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand dollars in gold to Harvey and William, and told where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar. So these two frauds said they\\'d go and fetch it up, and have everything square and above-board; and told me to come with a candle. We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bag they spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all them yaller-boys. My, the way the king\\'s eyes did shine! He slaps the duke on the shoulder and says: \"Oh, _this_ ain\\'t bully nor noth\\'n! Oh, no, I reckon not! Why, _bully_, it beats the Nonesuch, _don\\'t_ it?\" The duke allowed it did. They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the king says: \"It ain\\'t no use talkin\\'; bein\\' brothers to a rich dead man and representatives of furrin heirs that\\'s got left is the line for you and me, Bilge. Thish yer comes of trust\\'n to Providence. It\\'s the best way, in the long run. I\\'ve tried \\'em all, and ther\\' ain\\'t no better way.\" Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it on trust; but no, they must count it. So they counts it, and it comes out four hundred and fifteen dollars short. Says the king: \"Dern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen dollars?\" They worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it. Then the duke says: \"Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake--I reckon that\\'s the way of it. The best way\\'s to let it go, and keep still about it. We can spare it.\" \"Oh, shucks, yes, we can _spare_ it. I don\\'t k\\'yer noth\\'n \\'bout that--it\\'s the _count_ I\\'m thinkin\\' about. We want to be awful square and open and above-board here, you know. We want to lug this h-yer money up stairs and count it before everybody--then ther\\' ain\\'t noth\\'n suspicious. But when the dead man says ther\\'s six thous\\'n dollars, you know, we don\\'t want to--\" \"Hold on,\" says the duke. \"Le\\'s make up the deffisit,\" and he begun to haul out yaller-boys out of his pocket. \"It\\'s a most amaz\\'n\\' good idea, duke--you _have_ got a rattlin\\' clever head on you,\" says the king. \"Blest if the old Nonesuch ain\\'t a heppin\\' us out agin,\" and _he_ begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them up. It most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and clear. \"Say,\" says the duke, \"I got another idea. Le\\'s go up stairs and count this money, and then take and _give it to the girls_.\" \"Good land, duke, lemme hug you! It\\'s the most dazzling idea \\'at ever a man struck. You have cert\\'nly got the most astonishin\\' head I ever see. Oh, this is the boss dodge, ther\\' ain\\'t no mistake \\'bout it. Let \\'em fetch along their suspicions now if they want to--this \\'ll lay \\'em out.\" When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the king he counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile--twenty elegant little piles. Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked their chops. Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see the king begin to swell himself up for another speech. He says: \"Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them that\\'s left behind in the vale of sorrers. He has done generous by these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that\\'s left fatherless and motherless. Yes, and we that knowed him knows that he would a done _more_ generous by \\'em if he hadn\\'t ben afeard o\\' woundin\\' his dear William and me. Now, _wouldn\\'t_ he? Ther\\' ain\\'t no question \\'bout it in _my_ mind. Well, then, what kind o\\' brothers would it be that \\'d stand in his way at sech a time? And what kind o\\' uncles would it be that \\'d rob--yes, _rob_--sech poor sweet lambs as these \\'at he loved so at sech a time? If I know William--and I _think_ I do--he--well, I\\'ll jest ask him.\" He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with his hands, and the duke he looks at him stupid and leather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his meaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all his might for joy, and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up. Then the king says, \"I knowed it; I reckon _that \\'ll_ convince anybody the way _he_ feels about it. Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take the money--take it _all_. It\\'s the gift of him that lays yonder, cold but joyful.\" Mary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for the duke, and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet. And everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the hands off of them frauds, saying all the time: \"You _dear_ good souls!--how _lovely_!--how _could_ you!\" Well, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again, and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; and before long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside, and stood a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody saying anything to him either, because the king was talking and they was all busy listening. The king was saying--in the middle of something he\\'d started in on-- \"--they bein\\' partickler friends o\\' the diseased. That\\'s why they\\'re invited here this evenin\\'; but tomorrow we want _all_ to come--everybody; for he respected everybody, he liked everybody, and so it\\'s fitten that his funeral orgies sh\\'d be public.\" And so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke he couldn\\'t stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper, \"_Obsequies_, you old fool,\" and folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and reaching it over people\\'s heads to him. The king he reads it and puts it in his pocket, and says: \"Poor William, afflicted as he is, his _heart\\'s_ aluz right. Asks me to invite everybody to come to the funeral--wants me to make \\'em all welcome. But he needn\\'t a worried--it was jest what I was at.\" Then he weaves along again, perfectly ca\\'m, and goes to dropping in his funeral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before. And when he done it the third time he says: \"I say orgies, not because it\\'s the common term, because it ain\\'t--obsequies bein\\' the common term--but because orgies is the right term. Obsequies ain\\'t used in England no more now--it\\'s gone out. We say orgies now in England. Orgies is better, because it means the thing you\\'re after more exact. It\\'s a word that\\'s made up out\\'n the Greek _orgo_, outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew _jeesum_, to plant, cover up; hence in_ter._ So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public funeral.\" He was the _worst_ I ever struck. Well, the iron-jawed man he laughed right in his face. Everybody was shocked. Everybody says, \"Why, _doctor_!\" and Abner Shackleford says: \"Why, Robinson, hain\\'t you heard the news? This is Harvey Wilks.\" The king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and says: \"Is it my poor brother\\'s dear good friend and physician? I--\" \"Keep your hands off of me!\" says the doctor. \"_You_ talk like an Englishman, _don\\'t_ you? It\\'s the worst imitation I ever heard. _You_ Peter Wilks\\'s brother! You\\'re a fraud, that\\'s what you are!\" Well, how they all took on! They crowded around the doctor and tried to quiet him down, and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey \\'d showed in forty ways that he _was_ Harvey, and knowed everybody by name, and the names of the very dogs, and begged and _begged_ him not to hurt Harvey\\'s feelings and the poor girl\\'s feelings, and all that. But it warn\\'t no use; he stormed right along, and said any man that pretended to be an Englishman and couldn\\'t imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a fraud and a liar. The poor girls was hanging to the king and crying; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on _them_. He says: \"I was your father\\'s friend, and I\\'m your friend; and I warn you as a friend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of harm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing to do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew, as he calls it. He is the thinnest kind of an impostor--has come here with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres, and you take them for _proofs_, and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish friends here, who ought to know better. Mary Jane Wilks, you know me for your friend, and for your unselfish friend, too. Now listen to me; turn this pitiful rascal out--I _beg_ you to do it. Will you?\" Mary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome! She says: \"_Here_ is my answer.\" She hove up the bag of money and put it in the king\\'s hands, and says, \"Take this six thousand dollars, and invest for me and my sisters any way you want to, and don\\'t give us no receipt for it.\" Then she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and the hare-lip done the same on the other. Everybody clapped their hands and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his head and smiled proud. The doctor says: \"All right; I wash _my_ hands of the matter. But I warn you all that a time \\'s coming when you\\'re going to feel sick whenever you think of this day.\" And away he went. \"All right, doctor,\" says the king, kinder mocking him; \"we\\'ll try and get \\'em to send for you;\" which made them all laugh, and they said it was a prime good hit. ',\n",
              " 'XXVI. WELL, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off for spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do for Uncle William, and she\\'d give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which was a little bigger, and she would turn into the room with her sisters and sleep on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with a pallet in it. The king said the cubby would do for his valley--meaning me. So Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was plain but nice. She said she\\'d have her frocks and a lot of other traps took out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey\\'s way, but he said they warn\\'t. The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor. There was an old hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in another, and all sorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room with. The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for these fixings, and so don\\'t disturb them. The duke\\'s room was pretty small, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby. That night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there, and I stood behind the king and the duke\\'s chairs and waited on them, and the niggers waited on the rest. Mary Jane she set at the head of the table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the biscuits was, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the fried chickens was--and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for to force out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop, and said so--said \"How _do_ you get biscuits to brown so nice?\" and \"Where, for the land\\'s sake, _did_ you get these amaz\\'n pickles?\" and all that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does at a supper, you know. And when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen off of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up the things. The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blest if I didn\\'t think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes. She says: \"Did you ever see the king?\" \"Who? William Fourth? Well, I bet I have--he goes to our church.\" I knowed he was dead years ago, but I never let on. So when I says he goes to our church, she says: \"What--regular?\" \"Yes--regular. His pew\\'s right over opposite ourn--on t\\'other side the pulpit.\" \"I thought he lived in London?\" \"Well, he does. Where _would_ he live?\" \"But I thought _you_ lived in Sheffield?\" I see I was up a stump. I had to let on to get choked with a chicken bone, so as to get time to think how to get down again. Then I says: \"I mean he goes to our church regular when he\\'s in Sheffield. That\\'s only in the summer time, when he comes there to take the sea baths.\" \"Why, how you talk--Sheffield ain\\'t on the sea.\" \"Well, who said it was?\" \"Why, you did.\" \"I _didn\\'t_ nuther.\" \"You did!\" \"I didn\\'t.\" \"You did.\" \"I never said nothing of the kind.\" \"Well, what _did_ you say, then?\" \"Said he come to take the sea _baths_--that\\'s what I said.\" \"Well, then, how\\'s he going to take the sea baths if it ain\\'t on the sea?\" \"Looky here,\" I says; \"did you ever see any Congress-water?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, did you have to go to Congress to get it?\" \"Why, no.\" \"Well, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea bath.\" \"How does he get it, then?\" \"Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water--in barrels. There in the palace at Sheffield they\\'ve got furnaces, and he wants his water hot. They can\\'t bile that amount of water away off there at the sea. They haven\\'t got no conveniences for it.\" \"Oh, I see, now. You might a said that in the first place and saved time.\" When she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was comfortable and glad. Next, she says: \"Do you go to church, too?\" \"Yes--regular.\" \"Where do you set?\" \"Why, in our pew.\" \"_Whose_ pew?\" \"Why, _ourn_--your Uncle Harvey\\'s.\" \"His\\'n? What does _he_ want with a pew?\" \"Wants it to set in. What did you _reckon_ he wanted with it?\" \"Why, I thought he\\'d be in the pulpit.\" Rot him, I forgot he was a preacher. I see I was up a stump again, so I played another chicken bone and got another think. Then I says: \"Blame it, do you suppose there ain\\'t but one preacher to a church?\" \"Why, what do they want with more?\" \"What!--to preach before a king? I never did see such a girl as you. They don\\'t have no less than seventeen.\" \"Seventeen! My land! Why, I wouldn\\'t set out such a string as that, not if I _never_ got to glory. It must take \\'em a week.\" \"Shucks, they don\\'t _all_ of \\'em preach the same day--only _one_ of \\'em.\" \"Well, then, what does the rest of \\'em do?\" \"Oh, nothing much. Loll around, pass the plate--and one thing or another. But mainly they don\\'t do nothing.\" \"Well, then, what are they _for_?\" \"Why, they\\'re for _style_. Don\\'t you know nothing?\" \"Well, I don\\'t _want_ to know no such foolishness as that. How is servants treated in England? Do they treat \\'em better \\'n we treat our niggers?\" \"_No_! A servant ain\\'t nobody there. They treat them worse than dogs.\" \"Don\\'t they give \\'em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year\\'s week, and Fourth of July?\" \"Oh, just listen! A body could tell _you_ hain\\'t ever been to England by that. Why, Hare-l--why, Joanna, they never see a holiday from year\\'s end to year\\'s end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor nigger shows, nor nowheres.\" \"Nor church?\" \"Nor church.\" \"But _you_ always went to church.\" Well, I was gone up again. I forgot I was the old man\\'s servant. But next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from a common servant and _had_ to go to church whether he wanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of its being the law. But I didn\\'t do it pretty good, and when I got done I see she warn\\'t satisfied. She says: \"Honest injun, now, hain\\'t you been telling me a lot of lies?\" \"Honest injun,\" says I. \"None of it at all?\" \"None of it at all. Not a lie in it,\" says I. \"Lay your hand on this book and say it.\" I see it warn\\'t nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it and said it. So then she looked a little better satisfied, and says: \"Well, then, I\\'ll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious if I\\'ll believe the rest.\" \"What is it you won\\'t believe, Joe?\" says Mary Jane, stepping in with Susan behind her. \"It ain\\'t right nor kind for you to talk so to him, and him a stranger and so far from his people. How would you like to be treated so?\" \"That\\'s always your way, Maim--always sailing in to help somebody before they\\'re hurt. I hain\\'t done nothing to him. He\\'s told some stretchers, I reckon, and I said I wouldn\\'t swallow it all; and that\\'s every bit and grain I _did_ say. I reckon he can stand a little thing like that, can\\'t he?\" \"I don\\'t care whether \\'twas little or whether \\'twas big; he\\'s here in our house and a stranger, and it wasn\\'t good of you to say it. If you was in his place it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn\\'t to say a thing to another person that will make _them_ feel ashamed.\" \"Why, Mam, he said--\" \"It don\\'t make no difference what he _said_--that ain\\'t the thing. The thing is for you to treat him _kind_, and not be saying things to make him remember he ain\\'t in his own country and amongst his own folks.\" I says to myself, _this_ is a girl that I\\'m letting that old reptile rob her of her money! Then Susan _she_ waltzed in; and if you\\'ll believe me, she did give Hare-lip hark from the tomb! Says I to myself, and this is _another_ one that I\\'m letting him rob her of her money! Then Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely again--which was her way; but when she got done there warn\\'t hardly anything left o\\' poor Hare-lip. So she hollered. \"All right, then,\" says the other girls; \"you just ask his pardon.\" She done it, too; and she done it beautiful. She done it so beautiful it was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so she could do it again. I says to myself, this is _another_ one that I\\'m letting him rob her of her money. And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends. I felt so ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my mind\\'s made up; I\\'ll hive that money for them or bust. So then I lit out--for bed, I said, meaning some time or another. When I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over. I says to myself, shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds? No--that won\\'t do. He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would make it warm for me. Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane? No--I dasn\\'t do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they\\'ve got the money, and they\\'d slide right out and get away with it. If she was to fetch in help I\\'d get mixed up in the business before it was done with, I judge. No; there ain\\'t no good way but one. I got to steal that money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won\\'t suspicion that I done it. They\\'ve got a good thing here, and they ain\\'t a-going to leave till they\\'ve played this family and this town for all they\\'re worth, so I\\'ll find a chance time enough. I\\'ll steal it and hide it; and by and by, when I\\'m away down the river, I\\'ll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it\\'s hid. But I better hive it tonight if I can, because the doctor maybe hasn\\'t let up as much as he lets on he has; he might scare them out of here yet. So, thinks I, I\\'ll go and search them rooms. Upstairs the hall was dark, but I found the duke\\'s room, and started to paw around it with my hands; but I recollected it wouldn\\'t be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to his room and begun to paw around there. But I see I couldn\\'t do nothing without a candle, and I dasn\\'t light one, of course. So I judged I\\'d got to do the other thing--lay for them and eavesdrop. About that time I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I reached for it, but it wasn\\'t where I thought it would be; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane\\'s frocks, so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still. They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed. Then I was glad I hadn\\'t found the bed when I wanted it. And yet, you know, it\\'s kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private. They sets down then, and the king says: \"Well, what is it? And cut it middlin\\' short, because it\\'s better for us to be down there a-whoopin\\' up the mournin\\' than up here givin\\' \\'em a chance to talk us over.\" \"Well, this is it, Capet. I ain\\'t easy; I ain\\'t comfortable. That doctor lays on my mind. I wanted to know your plans. I\\'ve got a notion, and I think it\\'s a sound one.\" \"What is it, duke?\" \"That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clip it down the river with what we\\'ve got. Specially, seeing we got it so easy--_given_ back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of course we allowed to have to steal it back. I\\'m for knocking off and lighting out.\" That made me feel pretty bad. About an hour or two ago it would a been a little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The king rips out and says: \"What! And not sell out the rest o\\' the property? March off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous\\'n\\' dollars\\' worth o\\' property layin\\' around jest sufferin\\' to be scooped in?--and all good, salable stuff, too.\" The duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn\\'t want to go no deeper--didn\\'t want to rob a lot of orphans of _everything_ they had. \"Why, how you talk!\" says the king. \"We sha\\'n\\'t rob \\'em of nothing at all but jest this money. The people that _buys_ the property is the suff\\'rers; because as soon \\'s it\\'s found out \\'at we didn\\'t own it--which won\\'t be long after we\\'ve slid--the sale won\\'t be valid, and it \\'ll all go back to the estate. These yer orphans \\'ll git their house back agin, and that\\'s enough for _them_; they\\'re young and spry, and k\\'n easy earn a livin\\'. _they_ ain\\'t a-goin to suffer. Why, jest think--there\\'s thous\\'n\\'s and thous\\'n\\'s that ain\\'t nigh so well off. Bless you, _they_ ain\\'t got noth\\'n\\' to complain of.\" Well, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all right, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that doctor hanging over them. But the king says: \"Cuss the doctor! What do we k\\'yer for _him_? Hain\\'t we got all the fools in town on our side? And ain\\'t that a big enough majority in any town?\" So they got ready to go down stairs again. The duke says: \"I don\\'t think we put that money in a good place.\" That cheered me up. I\\'d begun to think I warn\\'t going to get a hint of no kind to help me. The king says: \"Why?\" \"Because Mary Jane \\'ll be in mourning from this out; and first you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up and put \\'em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it?\" \"Your head\\'s level agin, duke,\" says the king; and he comes a-fumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where I was. I stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think what I\\'d better do if they did catch me. But the king he got the bag before I could think more than about a half a thought, and he never suspicioned I was around. They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger only makes up the feather-bed, and don\\'t turn over the straw tick only about twice a year, and so it warn\\'t in no danger of getting stole now. But I knowed better. I had it out of there before they was half-way down stairs. I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I could get a chance to do better. I judged I better hide it outside of the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking: I knowed that very well. Then I turned in, with my clothes all on; but I couldn\\'t a gone to sleep if I\\'d a wanted to, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business. By and by I heard the king and the duke come up; so I rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to see if anything was going to happen. But nothing did. So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn\\'t begun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder. ',\n",
              " 'XXVII. I crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring. So I tiptoed along, and got down stairs all right. There warn\\'t a sound anywheres. I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs. The door was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a candle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but I see there warn\\'t nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn\\'t there. Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me. I run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only place I see to hide the bag was in the coffin. The lid was shoved along about a foot, showing the dead man\\'s face down in there, with a wet cloth over it, and his shroud on. I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just down beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door. The person coming was Mary Jane. She went to the coffin, very soft, and kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see she begun to cry, though I couldn\\'t hear her, and her back was to me. I slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I\\'d make sure them watchers hadn\\'t seen me; so I looked through the crack, and everything was all right. They hadn\\'t stirred. I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing playing out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much resk about it. Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because when we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to Mary Jane, and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain\\'t the thing that\\'s going to happen; the thing that\\'s going to happen is, the money \\'ll be found when they come to screw on the lid. Then the king \\'ll get it again, and it \\'ll be a long day before he gives anybody another chance to smouch it from him. Of course I _wanted_ to slide down and get it out of there, but I dasn\\'t try it. Every minute it was getting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir, and I might get catched--catched with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody hadn\\'t hired me to take care of. I don\\'t wish to be mixed up in no such business as that, I says to myself. When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and the watchers was gone. There warn\\'t nobody around but the family and the widow Bartley and our tribe. I watched their faces to see if anything had been happening, but I couldn\\'t tell. Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full. I see the coffin lid was the way it was before, but I dasn\\'t go to look in under it, with folks around. Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour the people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the dead man\\'s face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was all very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a little. There warn\\'t no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing noses--because people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places except church. When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last touches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable, and making no more sound than a cat. He never spoke; he moved people around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done it with nods, and signs with his hands. Then he took his place over against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and there warn\\'t no more smile to him than there is to a ham. They had borrowed a melodeum--a sick one; and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one that had a good thing, according to my notion. Then the Reverend Hobson opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only one dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait--you couldn\\'t hear yourself think. It was right down awkward, and nobody didn\\'t seem to know what to do. But pretty soon they see that long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say, \"Don\\'t you worry--just depend on me.\" Then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people\\'s heads. So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two sides of the room, he disappears down cellar. Then in about two seconds we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off. In a minute or two here comes this undertaker\\'s back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher, over the people\\'s heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, \"_He had a rat_!\" Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place. You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people, because naturally they wanted to know. A little thing like that don\\'t cost nothing, and it\\'s just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked. There warn\\'t no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was. Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and at last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screw-driver. I was in a sweat then, and watched him pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as soft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast. So there I was! I didn\\'t know whether the money was in there or not. So, says I, s\\'pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly?--now how do I know whether to write to Mary Jane or not? S\\'pose she dug him up and didn\\'t find nothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I might get hunted up and jailed; I\\'d better lay low and keep dark, and not write at all; the thing\\'s awful mixed now; trying to better it, I\\'ve worsened it a hundred times, and I wish to goodness I\\'d just let it alone, dad fetch the whole business! They buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces again--I couldn\\'t help it, and I couldn\\'t rest easy. But nothing come of it; the faces didn\\'t tell me nothing. The king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up, and made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his congregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home. He was very sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he could stay longer, but they said they could see it couldn\\'t be done. And he said of course him and William would take the girls home with them; and that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed and amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too--tickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready. Them poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting fooled and lied to so, but I didn\\'t see no safe way for me to chip in and change the general tune. Well, blamed if the king didn\\'t bill the house and the niggers and all the property for auction straight off--sale two days after the funeral; but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to. So the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls\\' joy got the first jolt. A couple of nigger traders come along, and the king sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their mother down the river to Orleans. I thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each other, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it. The girls said they hadn\\'t ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town. I can\\'t ever get it out of my memory, the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other\\'s necks and crying; and I reckon I couldn\\'t a stood it all, but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn\\'t knowed the sale warn\\'t no account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two. The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way. It injured the frauds some; but the old fool he bulled right along, spite of all the duke could say or do, and I tell you the duke was powerful uneasy. Next day was auction day. About broad day in the morning the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look that there was trouble. The king says: \"Was you in my room night before last?\" \"No, your majesty\"--which was the way I always called him when nobody but our gang warn\\'t around. \"Was you in there yisterday er last night?\" \"No, your majesty.\" \"Honor bright, now--no lies.\" \"Honor bright, your majesty, I\\'m telling you the truth. I hain\\'t been a-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed it to you.\" The duke says: \"Have you seen anybody else go in there?\" \"No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe.\" \"Stop and think.\" I studied awhile and see my chance; then I says: \"Well, I see the niggers go in there several times.\" Both of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn\\'t ever expected it, and then like they _had_. Then the duke says: \"What, all of them?\" \"No--leastways, not all at once--that is, I don\\'t think I ever see them all come _out_ at once but just one time.\" \"Hello! When was that?\" \"It was the day we had the funeral. In the morning. It warn\\'t early, because I overslept. I was just starting down the ladder, and I see them.\" \"Well, go on, _go_ on! What did they do? How\\'d they act?\" \"They didn\\'t do nothing. And they didn\\'t act anyway much, as fur as I see. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they\\'d shoved in there to do up your majesty\\'s room, or something, s\\'posing you was up; and found you _warn\\'t_ up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn\\'t already waked you up.\" \"Great guns, _this_ is a go!\" says the king; and both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly. They stood there a-thinking and scratching their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle, and says: \"It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand. They let on to be _sorry_ they was going out of this region! And I believed they _was_ sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody. Don\\'t ever tell _me_ any more that a nigger ain\\'t got any histrionic talent. Why, the way they played that thing it would fool _anybody_. In my opinion, there\\'s a fortune in \\'em. If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn\\'t want a better lay-out than that--and here we\\'ve gone and sold \\'em for a song. Yes, and ain\\'t privileged to sing the song yet. Say, where _is_ that song--that draft?\" \"In the bank for to be collected. Where _would_ it be?\" \"Well, _that\\'s_ all right then, thank goodness.\" Says I, kind of timid-like: \"Is something gone wrong?\" The king whirls on me and rips out: \"None o\\' your business! You keep your head shet, and mind y\\'r own affairs--if you got any. Long as you\\'re in this town don\\'t you forgit _that_--you hear?\" Then he says to the duke, \"We got to jest swaller it and say noth\\'n\\': mum\\'s the word for _us_.\" As they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, and says: \"Quick sales _and_ small profits! It\\'s a good business--yes.\" The king snarls around on him and says: \"I was trying to do for the best in sellin\\' \\'em out so quick. If the profits has turned out to be none, lackin\\' considable, and none to carry, is it my fault any more\\'n it\\'s yourn?\" \"Well, _they\\'d_ be in this house yet and we _wouldn\\'t_ if I could a got my advice listened to.\" The king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped around and lit into _me_ again. He give me down the banks for not coming and _telling_ him I see the niggers come out of his room acting that way--said any fool would a _knowed_ something was up. And then waltzed in and cussed _himself_ awhile, and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he\\'d be blamed if he\\'d ever do it again. So they went off a-jawing; and I felt dreadful glad I\\'d worked it all off on to the niggers, and yet hadn\\'t done the niggers no harm by it. ',\n",
              " 'XXVIII. BY and by it was getting-up time. So I come down the ladder and started for down-stairs; but as I come to the girls\\' room the door was open, and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she\\'d been packing things in it--getting ready to go to England. But she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her hands, crying. I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would. I went in there and says: \"Miss Mary Jane, you can\\'t a-bear to see people in trouble, and I can\\'t--most always. Tell me about it.\" So she done it. And it was the niggers--I just expected it. She said the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her; she didn\\'t know _how_ she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the mother and the children warn\\'t ever going to see each other no more--and then busted out bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says: \"Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain\\'t _ever_ going to see each other any more!\" \"But they _will_--and inside of two weeks--and I _know_ it!\" says I. Laws, it was out before I could think! And before I could budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it _again_, say it _again_, say it _again_! I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close place. I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very impatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and eased-up, like a person that\\'s had a tooth pulled out. So I went to studying it out. I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks, though I ain\\'t had no experience, and can\\'t say for certain; but it looks so to me, anyway; and yet here\\'s a case where I\\'m blest if it don\\'t look to me like the truth is better and actuly _safer_ than a lie. I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it\\'s so kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it. Well, I says to myself at last, I\\'m a-going to chance it; I\\'ll up and tell the truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you\\'ll go to. Then I says: \"Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you could go and stay three or four days?\" \"Yes; Mr. Lothrop\\'s. Why?\" \"Never mind why yet. If I\\'ll tell you how I know the niggers will see each other again inside of two weeks--here in this house--and _prove_ how I know it--will you go to Mr. Lothrop\\'s and stay four days?\" \"Four days!\" she says; \"I\\'ll stay a year!\" \"All right,\" I says, \"I don\\'t want nothing more out of _you_ than just your word--I druther have it than another man\\'s kiss-the-Bible.\" She smiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, \"If you don\\'t mind it, I\\'ll shut the door--and bolt it.\" Then I come back and set down again, and says: \"Don\\'t you holler. Just set still and take it like a man. I got to tell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it\\'s a bad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain\\'t no help for it. These uncles of yourn ain\\'t no uncles at all; they\\'re a couple of frauds--regular dead-beats. There, now we\\'re over the worst of it, you can stand the rest middling easy.\" It jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal water now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher all the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she flung herself on to the king\\'s breast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen times--and then up she jumps, with her face afire like sunset, and says: \"The brute! Come, don\\'t waste a minute--not a _second_--we\\'ll have them tarred and feathered, and flung in the river!\" Says I: \"Cert\\'nly. But do you mean _before_ you go to Mr. Lothrop\\'s, or--\" \"Oh,\" she says, \"what am I _thinking_ about!\" she says, and set right down again. \"Don\\'t mind what I said--please don\\'t--you _won\\'t,_ now, _will_ you?\" Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that I said I would die first. \"I never thought, I was so stirred up,\" she says; \"now go on, and I won\\'t do so any more. You tell me what to do, and whatever you say I\\'ll do it.\" \"Well,\" I says, \"it\\'s a rough gang, them two frauds, and I\\'m fixed so I got to travel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not--I druther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws, and I\\'d be all right; but there\\'d be another person that you don\\'t know about who\\'d be in big trouble. Well, we got to save _him_, hain\\'t we? Of course. Well, then, we won\\'t blow on them.\" Saying them words put a good idea in my head. I see how maybe I could get me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave. But I didn\\'t want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions but me; so I didn\\'t want the plan to begin working till pretty late to-night. I says: \"Miss Mary Jane, I\\'ll tell you what we\\'ll do, and you won\\'t have to stay at Mr. Lothrop\\'s so long, nuther. How fur is it?\" \"A little short of four miles--right out in the country, back here.\" \"Well, that \\'ll answer. Now you go along out there, and lay low till nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you home again--tell them you\\'ve thought of something. If you get here before eleven put a candle in this window, and if I don\\'t turn up wait _till_ eleven, and _then_ if I don\\'t turn up it means I\\'m gone, and out of the way, and safe. Then you come out and spread the news around, and get these beats jailed.\" \"Good,\" she says, \"I\\'ll do it.\" \"And if it just happens so that I don\\'t get away, but get took up along with them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand, and you must stand by me all you can.\" \"Stand by you! indeed I will. They sha\\'n\\'t touch a hair of your head!\" she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said it, too. \"If I get away I sha\\'n\\'t be here,\" I says, \"to prove these rapscallions ain\\'t your uncles, and I couldn\\'t do it if I _was_ here. I could swear they was beats and bummers, that\\'s all, though that\\'s worth something. Well, there\\'s others can do that better than what I can, and they\\'re people that ain\\'t going to be doubted as quick as I\\'d be. I\\'ll tell you how to find them. Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper. There--\\'Royal Nonesuch, Bricksville.\\' Put it away, and don\\'t lose it. When the court wants to find out something about these two, let them send up to Bricksville and say they\\'ve got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch, and ask for some witnesses--why, you\\'ll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink, Miss Mary. And they\\'ll come a-biling, too.\" I judged we had got everything fixed about right now. So I says: \"Just let the auction go right along, and don\\'t worry. Nobody don\\'t have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on accounts of the short notice, and they ain\\'t going out of this till they get that money; and the way we\\'ve fixed it the sale ain\\'t going to count, and they ain\\'t going to get no money. It\\'s just like the way it was with the niggers--it warn\\'t no sale, and the niggers will be back before long. Why, they can\\'t collect the money for the _niggers_ yet--they\\'re in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary.\" \"Well,\" she says, \"I\\'ll run down to breakfast now, and then I\\'ll start straight for Mr. Lothrop\\'s.\" \"\\'Deed, _that_ ain\\'t the ticket, Miss Mary Jane,\" I says, \"by no manner of means; go _before_ breakfast.\" \"Why?\" \"What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?\" \"Well, I never thought--and come to think, I don\\'t know. What was it?\" \"Why, it\\'s because you ain\\'t one of these leather-face people. I don\\'t want no better book than what your face is. A body can set down and read it off like coarse print. Do you reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never--\" \"There, there, don\\'t! Yes, I\\'ll go before breakfast--I\\'ll be glad to. And leave my sisters with them?\" \"Yes; never mind about them. They\\'ve got to stand it yet a while. They might suspicion something if all of you was to go. I don\\'t want you to see them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something. No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I\\'ll fix it with all of them. I\\'ll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say you\\'ve went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change, or to see a friend, and you\\'ll be back to-night or early in the morning.\" \"Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won\\'t have my love given to them.\" \"Well, then, it sha\\'n\\'t be.\" It was well enough to tell _her_ so--no harm in it. It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it\\'s the little things that smooths people\\'s roads the most, down here below; it would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn\\'t cost nothing. Then I says: \"There\\'s one more thing--that bag of money.\" \"Well, they\\'ve got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think _how_ they got it.\" \"No, you\\'re out, there. They hain\\'t got it.\" \"Why, who\\'s got it?\" \"I wish I knowed, but I don\\'t. I _had_ it, because I stole it from them; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I\\'m afraid it ain\\'t there no more. I\\'m awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I\\'m just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest. I come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I come to, and run--and it warn\\'t a good place.\" \"Oh, stop blaming yourself--it\\'s too bad to do it, and I won\\'t allow it--you couldn\\'t help it; it wasn\\'t your fault. Where did you hide it?\" I didn\\'t want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I couldn\\'t seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach. So for a minute I didn\\'t say nothing; then I says: \"I\\'d ruther not _tell_ you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don\\'t mind letting me off; but I\\'ll write it for you on a piece of paper, and you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop\\'s, if you want to. Do you reckon that \\'ll do?\" \"Oh, yes.\" So I wrote: \"I put it in the coffin. It was in there when you was crying there, away in the night. I was behind the door, and I was mighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.\" It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own roof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it to her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the hand, hard, and says: \"_Good_-bye. I\\'m going to do everything just as you\\'ve told me; and if I don\\'t ever see you again, I sha\\'n\\'t ever forget you and I\\'ll think of you a many and a many a time, and I\\'ll _pray_ for you, too!\"--and she was gone. Pray for me! I reckoned if she knowed me she\\'d take a job that was more nearer her size. But I bet she done it, just the same--she was just that kind. She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion--there warn\\'t no back-down to her, I judge. You may say what you want to, but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in my opinion she was just full of sand. It sounds like flattery, but it ain\\'t no flattery. And when it comes to beauty--and goodness, too--she lays over them all. I hain\\'t ever seen her since that time that I see her go out of that door; no, I hain\\'t ever seen her since, but I reckon I\\'ve thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying she would pray for me; and if ever I\\'d a thought it would do any good for me to pray for _her_, blamed if I wouldn\\'t a done it or bust. Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see her go. When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says: \"What\\'s the name of them people over on t\\'other side of the river that you all goes to see sometimes?\" They says: \"There\\'s several; but it\\'s the Proctors, mainly.\" \"That\\'s the name,\" I says; \"I most forgot it. Well, Miss Mary Jane she told me to tell you she\\'s gone over there in a dreadful hurry--one of them\\'s sick.\" \"Which one?\" \"I don\\'t know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it\\'s--\" \"Sakes alive, I hope it ain\\'t _Hanner_?\" \"I\\'m sorry to say it,\" I says, \"but Hanner\\'s the very one.\" \"My goodness, and she so well only last week! Is she took bad?\" \"It ain\\'t no name for it. They set up with her all night, Miss Mary Jane said, and they don\\'t think she\\'ll last many hours.\" \"Only think of that, now! What\\'s the matter with her?\" I couldn\\'t think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I says: \"Mumps.\" \"Mumps your granny! They don\\'t set up with people that\\'s got the mumps.\" \"They don\\'t, don\\'t they? You better bet they do with _these_ mumps. These mumps is different. It\\'s a new kind, Miss Mary Jane said.\" \"How\\'s it a new kind?\" \"Because it\\'s mixed up with other things.\" \"What other things?\" \"Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption, and yaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don\\'t know what all.\" \"My land! And they call it the _mumps_?\" \"That\\'s what Miss Mary Jane said.\" \"Well, what in the nation do they call it the _mumps_ for?\" \"Why, because it _is_ the mumps. That\\'s what it starts with.\" \"Well, ther\\' ain\\'t no sense in it. A body might stump his toe, and take pison, and fall down the well, and break his neck, and bust his brains out, and somebody come along and ask what killed him, and some numskull up and say, \\'Why, he stumped his _toe_.\\' Would ther\\' be any sense in that? _No_. And ther\\' ain\\'t no sense in _this_, nuther. Is it ketching?\" \"Is it _ketching_? Why, how you talk. Is a _harrow_ catching--in the dark? If you don\\'t hitch on to one tooth, you\\'re bound to on another, ain\\'t you? And you can\\'t get away with that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along, can you? Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow, as you may say--and it ain\\'t no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you come to get it hitched on good.\" \"Well, it\\'s awful, I think,\" says the hare-lip. \"I\\'ll go to Uncle Harvey and--\" \"Oh, yes,\" I says, \"I _would_. Of _course_ I would. I wouldn\\'t lose no time.\" \"Well, why wouldn\\'t you?\" \"Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see. Hain\\'t your uncles obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can? And do you reckon they\\'d be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves? _you_ know they\\'ll wait for you. So fur, so good. Your uncle Harvey\\'s a preacher, ain\\'t he? Very well, then; is a _preacher_ going to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive a _ship clerk?_--so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard? Now _you_ know he ain\\'t. What _will_ he do, then? Why, he\\'ll say, \\'It\\'s a great pity, but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps, and so it\\'s my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she\\'s got it.\\' But never mind, if you think it\\'s best to tell your uncle Harvey--\" \"Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane\\'s got it or not? Why, you talk like a muggins.\" \"Well, anyway, maybe you\\'d better tell some of the neighbors.\" \"Listen at that, now. You do beat all for natural stupidness. Can\\'t you _see_ that _they\\'d_ go and tell? Ther\\' ain\\'t no way but just to not tell anybody at _all_.\" \"Well, maybe you\\'re right--yes, I judge you _are_ right.\" \"But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she\\'s gone out a while, anyway, so he won\\'t be uneasy about her?\" \"Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that. She says, \\'Tell them to give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I\\'ve run over the river to see Mr.\\'--Mr.--what _is_ the name of that rich family your uncle Peter used to think so much of?--I mean the one that--\" \"Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain\\'t it?\" \"Of course; bother them kind of names, a body can\\'t ever seem to remember them, half the time, somehow. Yes, she said, say she has run over for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house, because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had it than anybody else; and she\\'s going to stick to them till they say they\\'ll come, and then, if she ain\\'t too tired, she\\'s coming home; and if she is, she\\'ll be home in the morning anyway. She said, don\\'t say nothing about the Proctors, but only about the Apthorps--which \\'ll be perfectly true, because she is going there to speak about their buying the house; I know it, because she told me so herself.\" \"All right,\" they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, and give them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message. Everything was all right now. The girls wouldn\\'t say nothing because they wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would ruther Mary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of Doctor Robinson. I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty neat--I reckoned Tom Sawyer couldn\\'t a done it no neater himself. Of course he would a throwed more style into it, but I can\\'t do that very handy, not being brung up to it. Well, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the end of the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old man he was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside of the auctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture now and then, or a little goody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he was around goo-gooing for sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading himself generly. But by and by the thing dragged through, and everything was sold--everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard. So they\\'d got to work that off--I never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow _everything_. Well, whilst they was at it a steamboat landed, and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping and yelling and laughing and carrying on, and singing out: \"_Here\\'s_ your opposition line! here\\'s your two sets o\\' heirs to old Peter Wilks--and you pays your money and you takes your choice!\" ',\n",
              " 'XXIX. THEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a nice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling. And, my souls, how the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up. But I didn\\'t see no joke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some to see any. I reckoned they\\'d turn pale. But no, nary a pale did _they_ turn. The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up, but just went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that\\'s googling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world. Oh, he done it admirable. Lots of the principal people gethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side. That old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death. Pretty soon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced _like_ an Englishman--not the king\\'s way, though the king\\'s _was_ pretty good for an imitation. I can\\'t give the old gent\\'s words, nor I can\\'t imitate him; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this: \"This is a surprise to me which I wasn\\'t looking for; and I\\'ll acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain\\'t very well fixed to meet it and answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he\\'s broke his arm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake. I am Peter Wilks\\' brother Harvey, and this is his brother William, which can\\'t hear nor speak--and can\\'t even make signs to amount to much, now\\'t he\\'s only got one hand to work them with. We are who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can prove it. But up till then I won\\'t say nothing more, but go to the hotel and wait.\" So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and blethers out: \"Broke his arm--_very_ likely, _ain\\'t_ it?--and very convenient, too, for a fraud that\\'s got to make signs, and ain\\'t learnt how. Lost their baggage! That\\'s _mighty_ good!--and mighty ingenious--under the _circumstances_!\" So he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four, or maybe half a dozen. One of these was that doctor; another one was a sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind made out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and was talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and then and nodding their heads--it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone up to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along and listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the king now. And when the king got done this husky up and says: \"Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when\\'d you come to this town?\" \"The day before the funeral, friend,\" says the king. \"But what time o\\' day?\" \"In the evenin\\'--\\'bout an hour er two before sundown.\" \"_How\\'d_ you come?\" \"I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati.\" \"Well, then, how\\'d you come to be up at the Pint in the _mornin_\\'--in a canoe?\" \"I warn\\'t up at the Pint in the mornin\\'.\" \"It\\'s a lie.\" Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an old man and a preacher. \"Preacher be hanged, he\\'s a fraud and a liar. He was up at the Pint that mornin\\'. I live up there, don\\'t I? Well, I was up there, and he was up there. I see him there. He come in a canoe, along with Tim Collins and a boy.\" The doctor he up and says: \"Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?\" \"I reckon I would, but I don\\'t know. Why, yonder he is, now. I know him perfectly easy.\" It was me he pointed at. The doctor says: \"Neighbors, I don\\'t know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if _these_ two ain\\'t frauds, I am an idiot, that\\'s all. I think it\\'s our duty to see that they don\\'t get away from here till we\\'ve looked into this thing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you. We\\'ll take these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t\\'other couple, and I reckon we\\'ll find out _something_ before we get through.\" It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king\\'s friends; so we all started. It was about sundown. The doctor he led me along by the hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand. We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and fetched in the new couple. First, the doctor says: \"I don\\'t wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they\\'re frauds, and they may have complices that we don\\'t know nothing about. If they have, won\\'t the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter Wilks left? It ain\\'t unlikely. If these men ain\\'t frauds, they won\\'t object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove they\\'re all right--ain\\'t that so?\" Everybody agreed to that. So I judged they had our gang in a pretty tight place right at the outstart. But the king he only looked sorrowful, and says: \"Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain\\'t got no disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation o\\' this misable business; but, alas, the money ain\\'t there; you k\\'n send and see, if you want to.\" \"Where is it, then?\" \"Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it inside o\\' the straw tick o\\' my bed, not wishin\\' to bank it for the few days we\\'d be here, and considerin\\' the bed a safe place, we not bein\\' used to niggers, and suppos\\'n\\' \\'em honest, like servants in England. The niggers stole it the very next mornin\\' after I had went down stairs; and when I sold \\'em I hadn\\'t missed the money yit, so they got clean away with it. My servant here k\\'n tell you \\'bout it, gentlemen.\" The doctor and several said \"Shucks!\" and I see nobody didn\\'t altogether believe him. One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it. I said no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I never thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them. That was all they asked me. Then the doctor whirls on me and says: \"Are _you_ English, too?\" I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, \"Stuff!\" Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about supper, nor ever seemed to think about it--and so they kept it up, and kept it up; and it _was_ the worst mixed-up thing you ever see. They made the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his\\'n; and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a _seen_ that the old gentleman was spinning truth and t\\'other one lies. And by and by they had me up to tell what I knowed. The king he give me a left-handed look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the right side. I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there, and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn\\'t get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says: \"Set down, my boy; I wouldn\\'t strain myself if I was you. I reckon you ain\\'t used to lying, it don\\'t seem to come handy; what you want is practice. You do it pretty awkward.\" I didn\\'t care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off, anyway. The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says: \"If you\\'d been in town at first, Levi Bell--\" The king broke in and reached out his hand, and says: \"Why, is this my poor dead brother\\'s old friend that he\\'s wrote so often about?\" The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side and talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says: \"That \\'ll fix it. I\\'ll take the order and send it, along with your brother\\'s, and then they\\'ll know it\\'s all right.\" So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted his head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something; and then they give the pen to the duke--and then for the first time the duke looked sick. But he took the pen and wrote. So then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says: \"You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.\" The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn\\'t read it. The lawyer looked powerful astonished, and says: \"Well, it beats _me_\"--and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket, and examined them, and then examined the old man\\'s writing, and then _them_ again; and then says: \"These old letters is from Harvey Wilks; and here\\'s _these_ two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn\\'t write them\" (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell you, to see how the lawyer had took them in), \"and here\\'s _this_ old gentleman\\'s hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, _he_ didn\\'t write them--fact is, the scratches he makes ain\\'t properly _writing_ at all. Now, here\\'s some letters from--\" The new old gentleman says: \"If you please, let me explain. Nobody can read my hand but my brother there--so he copies for me. It\\'s _his_ hand you\\'ve got there, not mine.\" \"_Well_!\" says the lawyer, \"this _is_ a state of things. I\\'ve got some of William\\'s letters, too; so if you\\'ll get him to write a line or so we can com--\" \"He _can\\'t_ write with his left hand,\" says the old gentleman. \"If he could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine too. Look at both, please--they\\'re by the same hand.\" The lawyer done it, and says: \"I believe it\\'s so--and if it ain\\'t so, there\\'s a heap stronger resemblance than I\\'d noticed before, anyway. Well, well, well! I thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it\\'s gone to grass, partly. But anyway, one thing is proved--_these_ two ain\\'t either of \\'em Wilkses\"--and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke. Well, what do you think? That muleheaded old fool wouldn\\'t give in _then_! Indeed he wouldn\\'t. Said it warn\\'t no fair test. Said his brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn\\'t tried to write--_he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper. And so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying _himself_; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says: \"I\\'ve thought of something. Is there anybody here that helped to lay out my br--helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?\" \"Yes,\" says somebody, \"me and Ab Turner done it. We\\'re both here.\" Then the old man turns towards the king, and says: \"Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?\" Blamed if the king didn\\'t have to brace up mighty quick, or he\\'d a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took him so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make most _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice, because how was _he_ going to know what was tattooed on the man? He whitened a little; he couldn\\'t help it; and it was mighty still in there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him. Says I to myself, _now_ he\\'ll throw up the sponge--there ain\\'t no more use. Well, did he? A body can\\'t hardly believe it, but he didn\\'t. I reckon he thought he\\'d keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so they\\'d thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away. Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says: \"Mf! It\\'s a _very_ tough question, _ain\\'t_ it! _yes_, sir, I k\\'n tell you what\\'s tattooed on his breast. It\\'s jest a small, thin, blue arrow--that\\'s what it is; and if you don\\'t look clost, you can\\'t see it. _now_ what do you say--hey?\" Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out cheek. The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and his eye lights up like he judged he\\'d got the king _this_ time, and says: \"There--you\\'ve heard what he said! Was there any such mark on Peter Wilks\\' breast?\" Both of them spoke up and says: \"We didn\\'t see no such mark.\" \"Good!\" says the old gentleman. \"Now, what you _did_ see on his breast was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was young), and a W, with dashes between them, so: P--B--W\"--and he marked them that way on a piece of paper. \"Come, ain\\'t that what you saw?\" Both of them spoke up again, and says: \"No, we _didn\\'t_. We never seen any marks at all.\" Well, everybody _was_ in a state of mind now, and they sings out: \"The whole _bilin_\\' of \\'m \\'s frauds! Le\\'s duck \\'em! le\\'s drown \\'em! le\\'s ride \\'em on a rail!\" and everybody was whooping at once, and there was a rattling powwow. But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells, and says: \"Gentlemen--gentle_men!_ Hear me just a word--just a _single_ word--if you _please_! There\\'s one way yet--let\\'s go and dig up the corpse and look.\" That took them. \"Hooray!\" they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer and the doctor sung out: \"Hold on, hold on! Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch _them_ along, too!\" \"We\\'ll do it!\" they all shouted; \"and if we don\\'t find them marks we\\'ll lynch the whole gang!\" I _was_ scared, now, I tell you. But there warn\\'t no getting away, you know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole town at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the evening. As we went by our house I wished I hadn\\'t sent Mary Jane out of town; because now if I could tip her the wink she\\'d light out and save me, and blow on our dead-beats. Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks. If they didn\\'t find them-- I couldn\\'t bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn\\'t think about nothing else. It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the wrist--Hines--and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip. He dragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up. When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an overflow. And when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn\\'t thought to fetch a lantern. But they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a mile off, to borrow one. So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took no notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute you could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the dark wiped it all out, and you couldn\\'t see nothing at all. At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to scrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it was awful. Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so, and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and panting. All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare, and somebody sings out: \"By the living jingo, here\\'s the bag of gold on his breast!\" Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there ain\\'t nobody can tell. I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew--leastways, I had it all to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along! When I struck the town I see there warn\\'t nobody out in the storm, so I never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the main one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set it. No light there; the house all dark--which made me feel sorry and disappointed, I didn\\'t know why. But at last, just as I was sailing by, _flash_ comes the light in Mary Jane\\'s window! and my heart swelled up sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark, and wasn\\'t ever going to be before me no more in this world. She _was_ the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand. The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the towhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first time the lightning showed me one that wasn\\'t chained I snatched it and shoved. It was a canoe, and warn\\'t fastened with nothing but a rope. The towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the middle of the river, but I didn\\'t lose no time; and when I struck the raft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp if I could afforded it. But I didn\\'t. As I sprung aboard I sung out: \"Out with you, Jim, and set her loose! Glory be to goodness, we\\'re shut of them!\" Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so full of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and lights out of me. But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and bless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the king and the duke, but I says: \"Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast! Cut loose and let her slide!\" So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it _did_ seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and nobody to bother us. I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crack my heels a few times--I couldn\\'t help it; but about the third crack I noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath and listened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted out over the water, here they come!--and just a-laying to their oars and making their skiff hum! It was the king and the duke. So I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and it was all I could do to keep from crying. ',\n",
              " 'XXX. WHEN they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar, and says: \"Tryin\\' to give us the slip, was ye, you pup! Tired of our company, hey?\" I says: \"No, your majesty, we warn\\'t--_please_ don\\'t, your majesty!\" \"Quick, then, and tell us what _was_ your idea, or I\\'ll shake the insides out o\\' you!\" \"Honest, I\\'ll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty. The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go of me and whispers, \\'Heel it now, or they\\'ll hang ye, sure!\\' and I lit out. It didn\\'t seem no good for _me_ to stay--I couldn\\'t do nothing, and I didn\\'t want to be hung if I could get away. So I never stopped running till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry, or they\\'d catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the duke wasn\\'t alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was awful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn\\'t.\" Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, \"Oh, yes, it\\'s _mighty_ likely!\" and shook me up again, and said he reckoned he\\'d drownd me. But the duke says: \"Leggo the boy, you old idiot! Would _you_ a done any different? Did you inquire around for _him_ when you got loose? I don\\'t remember it.\" So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it. But the duke says: \"You better a blame\\' sight give _yourself_ a good cussing, for you\\'re the one that\\'s entitled to it most. You hain\\'t done a thing from the start that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary blue-arrow mark. That _was_ bright--it was right down bully; and it was the thing that saved us. For if it hadn\\'t been for that they\\'d a jailed us till them Englishmen\\'s baggage come--and then--the penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took \\'em to the graveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the excited fools hadn\\'t let go all holts and made that rush to get a look we\\'d a slept in our cravats to-night--cravats warranted to _wear_, too--longer than _we\\'d_ need \\'em.\" They was still a minute--thinking; then the king says, kind of absent-minded like: \"Mf! And we reckoned the _niggers_ stole it!\" That made me squirm! \"Yes,\" says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, \"_we_ did.\" After about a half a minute the king drawls out: \"Leastways, I did.\" The duke says, the same way: \"On the contrary, I did.\" The king kind of ruffles up, and says: \"Looky here, Bilgewater, what\\'r you referrin\\' to?\" The duke says, pretty brisk: \"When it comes to that, maybe you\\'ll let me ask, what was _you_ referring to?\" \"Shucks!\" says the king, very sarcastic; \"but I don\\'t know--maybe you was asleep, and didn\\'t know what you was about.\" The duke bristles up now, and says: \"Oh, let _up_ on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame\\' fool? Don\\'t you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?\" \"_Yes_, sir! I know you _do_ know, because you done it yourself!\" \"It\\'s a lie!\"--and the duke went for him. The king sings out: \"Take y\\'r hands off!--leggo my throat!--I take it all back!\" The duke says: \"Well, you just own up, first, that you _did_ hide that money there, intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig it up, and have it all to yourself.\" \"Wait jest a minute, duke--answer me this one question, honest and fair; if you didn\\'t put the money there, say it, and I\\'ll b\\'lieve you, and take back everything I said.\" \"You old scoundrel, I didn\\'t, and you know I didn\\'t. There, now!\" \"Well, then, I b\\'lieve you. But answer me only jest this one more--now _don\\'t_ git mad; didn\\'t you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it?\" The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says: \"Well, I don\\'t care if I _did_, I didn\\'t _do_ it, anyway. But you not only had it in mind to do it, but you _done_ it.\" \"I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that\\'s honest. I won\\'t say I warn\\'t goin\\' to do it, because I _was_; but you--I mean somebody--got in ahead o\\' me.\" \"It\\'s a lie! You done it, and you got to _say_ you done it, or--\" The king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out: \"\\'Nough!--I _own up!_\" I was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier than what I was feeling before. So the duke took his hands off and says: \"If you ever deny it again I\\'ll drown you. It\\'s _well_ for you to set there and blubber like a baby--it\\'s fitten for you, after the way you\\'ve acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything--and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own father. You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for \\'em. It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to _believe_ that rubbage. Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit--you wanted to get what money I\\'d got out of the Nonesuch and one thing or another, and scoop it _all_!\" The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling: \"Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn\\'t me.\" \"Dry up! I don\\'t want to hear no more out of you!\" says the duke. \"And _now_ you see what you GOT by it. They\\'ve got all their own money back, and all of _ourn_ but a shekel or two _besides_. G\\'long to bed, and don\\'t you deffersit _me_ no more deffersits, long \\'s _you_ live!\" So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort, and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other\\'s arms. They both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn\\'t get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again. That made me feel easy and satisfied. Of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything. ',\n",
              " 'XXXI. WE dasn\\'t stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along down the river. We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty long ways from home. We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards. It was the first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and dismal. So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they begun to work the villages again. First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn\\'t make enough for them both to get drunk on. Then in another village they started a dancing-school; but they didn\\'t know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town. Another time they tried to go at yellocution; but they didn\\'t yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out. They tackled missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and a little of everything; but they couldn\\'t seem to have no luck. So at last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate. And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time. Jim and me got uneasy. We didn\\'t like the look of it. We judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever. We turned it over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into somebody\\'s house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money business, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an agreement that we wouldn\\'t have nothing in the world to do with such actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one morning we hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit of a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet. (\"House to rob, you _mean_,\" says I to myself; \"and when you get through robbing it you\\'ll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the raft--and you\\'ll have to take it out in wondering.\") And he said if he warn\\'t back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right, and we was to come along. So we stayed where we was. The duke he fretted and sweated around, and was in a mighty sour way. He scolded us for everything, and we couldn\\'t seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing. Something was a-brewing, sure. I was good and glad when midday come and no king; we could have a change, anyway--and maybe a chance for _the_ change on top of it. So me and the duke went up to the village, and hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all his might, and so tight he couldn\\'t walk, and couldn\\'t do nothing to them. The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king begun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like a deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me and Jim again. I got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out: \"Set her loose, Jim! we\\'re all right now!\" But there warn\\'t no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam. Jim was gone! I set up a shout--and then another--and then another one; and run this way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn\\'t no use--old Jim was gone. Then I set down and cried; I couldn\\'t help it. But I couldn\\'t set still long. Pretty soon I went out on the road, trying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy walking, and asked him if he\\'d seen a strange nigger dressed so and so, and he says: \"Yes.\" \"Whereabouts?\" says I. \"Down to Silas Phelps\\' place, two mile below here. He\\'s a runaway nigger, and they\\'ve got him. Was you looking for him?\" \"You bet I ain\\'t! I run across him in the woods about an hour or two ago, and he said if I hollered he\\'d cut my livers out--and told me to lay down and stay where I was; and I done it. Been there ever since; afeard to come out.\" \"Well,\" he says, \"you needn\\'t be afeard no more, becuz they\\'ve got him. He run off f\\'m down South, som\\'ers.\" \"It\\'s a good job they got him.\" \"Well, I _reckon_! There\\'s two hunderd dollars reward on him. It\\'s like picking up money out\\'n the road.\" \"Yes, it is--and I could a had it if I\\'d been big enough; I see him _first_. Who nailed him?\" \"It was an old fellow--a stranger--and he sold out his chance in him for forty dollars, becuz he\\'s got to go up the river and can\\'t wait. Think o\\' that, now! You bet _I\\'d_ wait, if it was seven year.\" \"That\\'s me, every time,\" says I. \"But maybe his chance ain\\'t worth no more than that, if he\\'ll sell it so cheap. Maybe there\\'s something ain\\'t straight about it.\" \"But it _is_, though--straight as a string. I see the handbill myself. It tells all about him, to a dot--paints him like a picture, and tells the plantation he\\'s frum, below Newr_leans_. No-sirree-_bob_, they ain\\'t no trouble \\'bout _that_ speculation, you bet you. Say, gimme a chaw tobacker, won\\'t ye?\" I didn\\'t have none, so he left. I went to the raft, and set down in the wigwam to think. But I couldn\\'t come to nothing. I thought till I wore my head sore, but I couldn\\'t see no way out of the trouble. After all this long journey, and after all we\\'d done for them scoundrels, here it was all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined, because they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and make him a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too, for forty dirty dollars. Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to be a slave at home where his family was, as long as he\\'d _got_ to be a slave, and so I\\'d better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to tell Miss Watson where he was. But I soon give up that notion for two things: she\\'d be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her, and so she\\'d sell him straight down the river again; and if she didn\\'t, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger, and they\\'d make Jim feel it all the time, and so he\\'d feel ornery and disgraced. And then think of _me_! It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see anybody from that town again I\\'d be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame. That\\'s just the way: a person does a low-down thing, and then he don\\'t want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he can hide it, it ain\\'t no disgrace. That was my fix exactly. The more I studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a poor old woman\\'s nigger that hadn\\'t ever done me no harm, and now was showing me there\\'s One that\\'s always on the lookout, and ain\\'t a-going to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further, I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared. Well, I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked, and so I warn\\'t so much to blame; but something inside of me kept saying, \"There was the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and if you\\'d a done it they\\'d a learnt you there that people that acts as I\\'d been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire.\" It made me shiver. And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I couldn\\'t try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better. So I kneeled down. But the words wouldn\\'t come. Why wouldn\\'t they? It warn\\'t no use to try and hide it from Him. Nor from _me_, neither. I knowed very well why they wouldn\\'t come. It was because my heart warn\\'t right; it was because I warn\\'t square; it was because I was playing double. I was letting _on_ to give up sin, but away inside of me I was holding on to the biggest one of all. I was trying to make my mouth _say_ I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write to that nigger\\'s owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. You can\\'t pray a lie--I found that out. So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn\\'t know what to do. At last I had an idea; and I says, I\\'ll go and write the letter--and then see if I can pray. Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone. So I got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down and wrote: Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send. _Huck Finn._ I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn\\'t do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I couldn\\'t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind. I\\'d see him standing my watch on top of his\\'n, \\'stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the _only_ one he\\'s got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper. It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I\\'d got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself: \"All right, then, I\\'ll _go_ to hell\"--and tore it up. It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn\\'t. And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog. Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that suited me. So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. I slept the night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast, and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore. I landed below where I judged was Phelps\\'s place, and hid my bundle in the woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank. Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it, \"Phelps\\'s Sawmill,\" and when I come to the farm-houses, two or three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn\\'t see nobody around, though it was good daylight now. But I didn\\'t mind, because I didn\\'t want to see nobody just yet--I only wanted to get the lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from the village, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved along, straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch--three-night performance--like that other time. They had the cheek, them frauds! I was right on him before I could shirk. He looked astonished, and says: \"Hel-_lo_! Where\\'d _you_ come from?\" Then he says, kind of glad and eager, \"Where\\'s the raft?--got her in a good place?\" I says: \"Why, that\\'s just what I was going to ask your grace.\" Then he didn\\'t look so joyful, and says: \"What was your idea for asking _me_?\" he says. \"Well,\" I says, \"when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says to myself, we can\\'t get him home for hours, till he\\'s soberer; so I went a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait. A man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat, and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after him. We didn\\'t have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out. We never got him till dark; then we fetched him over, and I started down for the raft. When I got there and see it was gone, I says to myself, \\'They\\'ve got into trouble and had to leave; and they\\'ve took my nigger, which is the only nigger I\\'ve got in the world, and now I\\'m in a strange country, and ain\\'t got no property no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;\\' so I set down and cried. I slept in the woods all night. But what _did_ become of the raft, then?--and Jim--poor Jim!\" \"Blamed if I know--that is, what\\'s become of the raft. That old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but what he\\'d spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and found the raft gone, we said, \\'That little rascal has stole our raft and shook us, and run off down the river.\\'\" \"I wouldn\\'t shake my _nigger_, would I?--the only nigger I had in the world, and the only property.\" \"We never thought of that. Fact is, I reckon we\\'d come to consider him _our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him so--goodness knows we had trouble enough for him. So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke, there warn\\'t anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another shake. And I\\'ve pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn. Where\\'s that ten cents? Give it here.\" I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the money I had, and I hadn\\'t had nothing to eat since yesterday. He never said nothing. The next minute he whirls on me and says: \"Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us? We\\'d skin him if he done that!\" \"How can he blow? Hain\\'t he run off?\" \"No! That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money\\'s gone.\" \"_Sold_ him?\" I says, and begun to cry; \"why, he was _my_ nigger, and that was my money. Where is he?--I want my nigger.\" \"Well, you can\\'t _get_ your nigger, that\\'s all--so dry up your blubbering. Looky here--do you think _you\\'d_ venture to blow on us? Blamed if I think I\\'d trust you. Why, if you _was_ to blow on us--\" He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before. I went on a-whimpering, and says: \"I don\\'t want to blow on nobody; and I ain\\'t got no time to blow, nohow. I got to turn out and find my nigger.\" He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead. At last he says: \"I\\'ll tell you something. We got to be here three days. If you\\'ll promise you won\\'t blow, and won\\'t let the nigger blow, I\\'ll tell you where to find him.\" So I promised, and he says: \"A farmer by the name of Silas Ph--\" and then he stopped. You see, he started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind. And so he was. He wouldn\\'t trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three days. So pretty soon he says: \"The man that bought him is named Abram Foster--Abram G. Foster--and he lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.\" \"All right,\" I says, \"I can walk it in three days. And I\\'ll start this very afternoon.\" \"No you wont, you\\'ll start _now_; and don\\'t you lose any time about it, neither, nor do any gabbling by the way. Just keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along, and then you won\\'t get into trouble with _us_, d\\'ye hear?\" That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for. I wanted to be left free to work my plans. \"So clear out,\" he says; \"and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger--some idiots don\\'t require documents--leastways I\\'ve heard there\\'s such down South here. And when you tell him the handbill and the reward\\'s bogus, maybe he\\'ll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting \\'em out. Go \\'long now, and tell him anything you want to; but mind you don\\'t work your jaw any _between_ here and there.\" So I left, and struck for the back country. I didn\\'t look around, but I kinder felt like he was watching me. But I knowed I could tire him out at that. I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps\\'. I reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling around, because I wanted to stop Jim\\'s mouth till these fellows could get away. I didn\\'t want no trouble with their kind. I\\'d seen all I wanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them. ',\n",
              " 'XXXII. WHEN I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny; the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybody\\'s dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it\\'s spirits whispering--spirits that\\'s been dead ever so many years--and you always think they\\'re talking about _you_. As a general thing it makes a body wish _he_ was dead, too, and done with it all. Phelps\\' was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and they all look alike. A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out of logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different length, to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand on when they are going to jump on to a horse; some sickly grass-patches in the big yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the nap rubbed off; big double log-house for the white folks--hewed logs, with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes been whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big broad, open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-house back of the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t\\'other side the smoke-house; one little hut all by itself away down against the back fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side; ash-hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench by the kitchen door, with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there in the sun; more hounds asleep round about; about three shade trees away off in a corner; some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence; outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then the cotton fields begins, and after the fields the woods. I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and started for the kitchen. When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum of a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again; and then I knowed for certain I wished I was dead--for that _is_ the lonesomest sound in the whole world. I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for I\\'d noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth if I left it alone. When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went for me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still. And such another powwow as they made! In a quarter of a minute I was a kind of a hub of a wheel, as you may say--spokes made out of dogs--circle of fifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses stretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; you could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres. A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her hand, singing out, \"Begone _you_ Tige! you Spot! begone sah!\" and she fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling, and then the rest followed; and the next second half of them come back, wagging their tails around me, and making friends with me. There ain\\'t no harm in a hound, nohow. And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to their mother\\'s gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the way they always do. And here comes the white woman running from the house, about forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick in her hand; and behind her comes her little white children, acting the same way the little niggers was doing. She was smiling all over so she could hardly stand--and says: \"It\\'s _you_, at last!--_ain\\'t_ it?\" I out with a \"Yes\\'m\" before I thought. She grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands and shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over; and she couldn\\'t seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, \"You don\\'t look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would; but law sakes, I don\\'t care for that, I\\'m so glad to see you! Dear, dear, it does seem like I could eat you up! Children, it\\'s your cousin Tom!--tell him howdy.\" But they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, and hid behind her. So she run on: \"Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away--or did you get your breakfast on the boat?\" I said I had got it on the boat. So then she started for the house, leading me by the hand, and the children tagging after. When we got there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says: \"Now I can have a _good_ look at you; and, laws-a-me, I\\'ve been hungry for it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it\\'s come at last! We been expecting you a couple of days and more. What kep\\' you?--boat get aground?\" \"Yes\\'m--she--\" \"Don\\'t say yes\\'m--say Aunt Sally. Where\\'d she get aground?\" I didn\\'t rightly know what to say, because I didn\\'t know whether the boat would be coming up the river or down. But I go a good deal on instinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up--from down towards Orleans. That didn\\'t help me much, though; for I didn\\'t know the names of bars down that way. I see I\\'d got to invent a bar, or forget the name of the one we got aground on--or--Now I struck an idea, and fetched it out: \"It warn\\'t the grounding--that didn\\'t keep us back but a little. We blowed out a cylinder-head.\" \"Good gracious! anybody hurt?\" \"No\\'m. Killed a nigger.\" \"Well, it\\'s lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt. Two years ago last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old Lally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man. And I think he died afterwards. He was a Baptist. Your uncle Silas knowed a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well. Yes, I remember now, he _did_ die. Mortification set in, and they had to amputate him. But it didn\\'t save him. Yes, it was mortification--that was it. He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection. They say he was a sight to look at. Your uncle\\'s been up to the town every day to fetch you. And he\\'s gone again, not more\\'n an hour ago; he\\'ll be back any minute now. You must a met him on the road, didn\\'t you?--oldish man, with a--\" \"No, I didn\\'t see nobody, Aunt Sally. The boat landed just at daylight, and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around the town and out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not get here too soon; and so I come down the back way.\" \"Who\\'d you give the baggage to?\" \"Nobody.\" \"Why, child, it \\'ll be stole!\" \"Not where I hid it I reckon it won\\'t,\" I says. \"How\\'d you get your breakfast so early on the boat?\" It was kinder thin ice, but I says: \"The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have something to eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers\\' lunch, and give me all I wanted.\" I was getting so uneasy I couldn\\'t listen good. I had my mind on the children all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little, and find out who I was. But I couldn\\'t get no show, Mrs. Phelps kept it up and run on so. Pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back, because she says: \"But here we\\'re a-running on this way, and you hain\\'t told me a word about Sis, nor any of them. Now I\\'ll rest my works a little, and you start up yourn; just tell me _everything_--tell me all about \\'m all every one of \\'m; and how they are, and what they\\'re doing, and what they told you to tell me; and every last thing you can think of.\" Well, I see I was up a stump--and up it good. Providence had stood by me this fur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now. I see it warn\\'t a bit of use to try to go ahead--I\\'d got to throw up my hand. So I says to myself, here\\'s another place where I got to resk the truth. I opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed, and says: \"Here he comes! Stick your head down lower--there, that\\'ll do; you can\\'t be seen now. Don\\'t you let on you\\'re here. I\\'ll play a joke on him. Children, don\\'t you say a word.\" I see I was in a fix now. But it warn\\'t no use to worry; there warn\\'t nothing to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to stand from under when the lightning struck. I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in; then the bed hid him. Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him, and says: \"Has he come?\" \"No,\" says her husband. \"Good-_ness_ gracious!\" she says, \"what in the warld can have become of him?\" \"I can\\'t imagine,\" says the old gentleman; \"and I must say it makes me dreadful uneasy.\" \"Uneasy!\" she says; \"I\\'m ready to go distracted! He _must_ a come; and you\\'ve missed him along the road. I _know_ it\\'s so--something tells me so.\" \"Why, Sally, I _couldn\\'t_ miss him along the road--_you_ know that.\" \"But oh, dear, dear, what _will_ Sis say! He must a come! You must a missed him. He--\" \"Oh, don\\'t distress me any more\\'n I\\'m already distressed. I don\\'t know what in the world to make of it. I\\'m at my wit\\'s end, and I don\\'t mind acknowledging \\'t I\\'m right down scared. But there\\'s no hope that he\\'s come; for he _couldn\\'t_ come and me miss him. Sally, it\\'s terrible--just terrible--something\\'s happened to the boat, sure!\" \"Why, Silas! Look yonder!--up the road!--ain\\'t that somebody coming?\" He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs. Phelps the chance she wanted. She stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the window there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, and I standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside. The old gentleman stared, and says: \"Why, who\\'s that?\" \"Who do you reckon \\'t is?\" \"I hain\\'t no idea. Who _is_ it?\" \"It\\'s _Tom Sawyer!_\" By jings, I most slumped through the floor! But there warn\\'t no time to swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on shaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary, and the rest of the tribe. But if they was joyful, it warn\\'t nothing to what I was; for it was like being born again, I was so glad to find out who I was. Well, they froze to me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it couldn\\'t hardly go any more, I had told them more about my family--I mean the Sawyer family--than ever happened to any six Sawyer families. And I explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of White River, and it took us three days to fix it. Which was all right, and worked first-rate; because _they_ didn\\'t know but what it would take three days to fix it. If I\\'d a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well. Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty uncomfortable all up the other. Being Tom Sawyer was easy and comfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a steamboat coughing along down the river. Then I says to myself, s\\'pose Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat? And s\\'pose he steps in here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet? Well, I couldn\\'t _have_ it that way; it wouldn\\'t do at all. I must go up the road and waylay him. So I told the folks I reckoned I would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage. The old gentleman was for going along with me, but I said no, I could drive the horse myself, and I druther he wouldn\\'t take no trouble about me. ',\n",
              " 'XXXIII. SO I started for town in the wagon, and when I was half-way I see a wagon coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I stopped and waited till he come along. I says \"Hold on!\" and it stopped alongside, and his mouth opened up like a trunk, and stayed so; and he swallowed two or three times like a person that\\'s got a dry throat, and then says: \"I hain\\'t ever done you no harm. You know that. So, then, what you want to come back and ha\\'nt _me_ for?\" I says: \"I hain\\'t come back--I hain\\'t been _gone_.\" When he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warn\\'t quite satisfied yet. He says: \"Don\\'t you play nothing on me, because I wouldn\\'t on you. Honest injun now, you ain\\'t a ghost?\" \"Honest injun, I ain\\'t,\" I says. \"Well--I--I--well, that ought to settle it, of course; but I can\\'t somehow seem to understand it no way. Looky here, warn\\'t you ever murdered _at all?_\" \"No. I warn\\'t ever murdered at all--I played it on them. You come in here and feel of me if you don\\'t believe me.\" So he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see me again he didn\\'t know what to do. And he wanted to know all about it right off, because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it hit him where he lived. But I said, leave it alone till by and by; and told his driver to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I told him the kind of a fix I was in, and what did he reckon we better do? He said, let him alone a minute, and don\\'t disturb him. So he thought and thought, and pretty soon he says: \"It\\'s all right; I\\'ve got it. Take my trunk in your wagon, and let on it\\'s your\\'n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to the house about the time you ought to; and I\\'ll go towards town a piece, and take a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you; and you needn\\'t let on to know me at first.\" I says: \"All right; but wait a minute. There\\'s one more thing--a thing that _nobody_ don\\'t know but me. And that is, there\\'s a nigger here that I\\'m a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his name is _Jim_--old Miss Watson\\'s Jim.\" He says: \"What! Why, Jim is--\" He stopped and went to studying. I says: \"I know what you\\'ll say. You\\'ll say it\\'s dirty, low-down business; but what if it is? I\\'m low down; and I\\'m a-going to steal him, and I want you keep mum and not let on. Will you?\" His eye lit up, and he says: \"I\\'ll _help_ you steal him!\" Well, I let go all holts then, like I was shot. It was the most astonishing speech I ever heard--and I\\'m bound to say Tom Sawyer fell considerable in my estimation. Only I couldn\\'t believe it. Tom Sawyer a _nigger-stealer!_ \"Oh, shucks!\" I says; \"you\\'re joking.\" \"I ain\\'t joking, either.\" \"Well, then,\" I says, \"joking or no joking, if you hear anything said about a runaway nigger, don\\'t forget to remember that _you_ don\\'t know nothing about him, and I don\\'t know nothing about him.\" Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his way and I drove mine. But of course I forgot all about driving slow on accounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip. The old gentleman was at the door, and he says: \"Why, this is wonderful! Whoever would a thought it was in that mare to do it? I wish we\\'d a timed her. And she hain\\'t sweated a hair--not a hair. It\\'s wonderful. Why, I wouldn\\'t take a hundred dollars for that horse now--I wouldn\\'t, honest; and yet I\\'d a sold her for fifteen before, and thought \\'twas all she was worth.\" That\\'s all he said. He was the innocentest, best old soul I ever see. But it warn\\'t surprising; because he warn\\'t only just a farmer, he was a preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log church down back of the plantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a church and schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and it was worth it, too. There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that, and done the same way, down South. In about half an hour Tom\\'s wagon drove up to the front stile, and Aunt Sally she see it through the window, because it was only about fifty yards, and says: \"Why, there\\'s somebody come! I wonder who \\'tis? Why, I do believe it\\'s a stranger. Jimmy\" (that\\'s one of the children) \"run and tell Lize to put on another plate for dinner.\" Everybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger don\\'t come _every_ year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, for interest, when he does come. Tom was over the stile and starting for the house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we was all bunched in the front door. Tom had his store clothes on, and an audience--and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer. In them circumstances it warn\\'t no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable. He warn\\'t a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep; no, he come ca\\'m and important, like the ram. When he got a-front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn\\'t want to disturb them, and says: \"Mr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?\" \"No, my boy,\" says the old gentleman, \"I\\'m sorry to say \\'t your driver has deceived you; Nichols\\'s place is down a matter of three mile more. Come in, come in.\" Tom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, \"Too late--he\\'s out of sight.\" \"Yes, he\\'s gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your dinner with us; and then we\\'ll hitch up and take you down to Nichols\\'s.\" \"Oh, I _can\\'t_ make you so much trouble; I couldn\\'t think of it. I\\'ll walk--I don\\'t mind the distance.\" \"But we won\\'t _let_ you walk--it wouldn\\'t be Southern hospitality to do it. Come right in.\" \"Oh, _do_,\" says Aunt Sally; \"it ain\\'t a bit of trouble to us, not a bit in the world. You must stay. It\\'s a long, dusty three mile, and we can\\'t let you walk. And, besides, I\\'ve already told \\'em to put on another plate when I see you coming; so you mustn\\'t disappoint us. Come right in and make yourself at home.\" So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be persuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a stranger from Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson--and he made another bow. Well, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville and everybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, and wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last, still talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the mouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and was going on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand, and says: \"You owdacious puppy!\" He looked kind of hurt, and says: \"I\\'m surprised at you, m\\'am.\" \"You\\'re s\\'rp--Why, what do you reckon I am? I\\'ve a good notion to take and--Say, what do you mean by kissing me?\" He looked kind of humble, and says: \"I didn\\'t mean nothing, m\\'am. I didn\\'t mean no harm. I--I--thought you\\'d like it.\" \"Why, you born fool!\" She took up the spinning stick, and it looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it. \"What made you think I\\'d like it?\" \"Well, I don\\'t know. Only, they--they--told me you would.\" \"_They_ told you I would. Whoever told you\\'s _another_ lunatic. I never heard the beat of it. Who\\'s _they_?\" \"Why, everybody. They all said so, m\\'am.\" It was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says: \"Who\\'s \\'everybody\\'? Out with their names, or ther\\'ll be an idiot short.\" He got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says: \"I\\'m sorry, and I warn\\'t expecting it. They told me to. They all told me to. They all said, kiss her; and said she\\'d like it. They all said it--every one of them. But I\\'m sorry, m\\'am, and I won\\'t do it no more--I won\\'t, honest.\" \"You won\\'t, won\\'t you? Well, I sh\\'d _reckon_ you won\\'t!\" \"No\\'m, I\\'m honest about it; I won\\'t ever do it again--till you ask me.\" \"Till I _ask_ you! Well, I never see the beat of it in my born days! I lay you\\'ll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I ask you--or the likes of you.\" \"Well,\" he says, \"it does surprise me so. I can\\'t make it out, somehow. They said you would, and I thought you would. But--\" He stopped and looked around slow, like he wished he could run across a friendly eye somewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman\\'s, and says, \"Didn\\'t _you_ think she\\'d like me to kiss her, sir?\" \"Why, no; I--I--well, no, I b\\'lieve I didn\\'t.\" Then he looks on around the same way to me, and says: \"Tom, didn\\'t _you_ think Aunt Sally \\'d open out her arms and say, \\'Sid Sawyer--\\'\" \"My land!\" she says, breaking in and jumping for him, \"you impudent young rascal, to fool a body so--\" and was going to hug him, but he fended her off, and says: \"No, not till you\\'ve asked me first.\" So she didn\\'t lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed him over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, and he took what was left. And after they got a little quiet again she says: \"Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise. We warn\\'t looking for _you_ at all, but only Tom. Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him.\" \"It\\'s because it warn\\'t _intended_ for any of us to come but Tom,\" he says; \"but I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let me come, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be a first-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for me to by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger. But it was a mistake, Aunt Sally. This ain\\'t no healthy place for a stranger to come.\" \"No--not impudent whelps, Sid. You ought to had your jaws boxed; I hain\\'t been so put out since I don\\'t know when. But I don\\'t care, I don\\'t mind the terms--I\\'d be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here. Well, to think of that performance! I don\\'t deny it, I was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack.\" We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven families--and all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that\\'s laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning. Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn\\'t cool it a bit, neither, the way I\\'ve seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times. There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me and Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn\\'t no use, they didn\\'t happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid to try to work up to it. But at supper, at night, one of the little boys says: \"Pa, mayn\\'t Tom and Sid and me go to the show?\" \"No,\" says the old man, \"I reckon there ain\\'t going to be any; and you couldn\\'t go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and me all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the people; so I reckon they\\'ve drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this time.\" So there it was!--but I couldn\\'t help it. Tom and me was to sleep in the same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and went up to bed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down the lightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn\\'t believe anybody was going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn\\'t hurry up and give them one they\\'d get into trouble sure. On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered, and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn\\'t come back no more, and what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had time to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of it--it was as much as half-after eight, then--here comes a raging rush of people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by; and as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a rail--that is, I knowed it _was_ the king and the duke, though they was all over tar and feathers, and didn\\'t look like nothing in the world that was human--just looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier-plumes. Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn\\'t ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world. It was a dreadful thing to see. Human beings _can_ be awful cruel to one another. We see we was too late--couldn\\'t do no good. We asked some stragglers about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and the house rose up and went for them. So we poked along back home, and I warn\\'t feeling so brash as I was before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow--though I hadn\\'t done nothing. But that\\'s always the way; it don\\'t make no difference whether you do right or wrong, a person\\'s conscience ain\\'t got no sense, and just goes for him anyway. If I had a yaller dog that didn\\'t know no more than a person\\'s conscience does I would pison him. It takes up more room than all the rest of a person\\'s insides, and yet ain\\'t no good, nohow. Tom Sawyer he says the same. ',\n",
              " 'XXXIV. WE stopped talking, and got to thinking. By and by Tom says: \"Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before! I bet I know where Jim is.\" \"No! Where?\" \"In that hut down by the ash-hopper. Why, looky here. When we was at dinner, didn\\'t you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?\" \"Yes.\" \"What did you think the vittles was for?\" \"For a dog.\" \"So \\'d I. Well, it wasn\\'t for a dog.\" \"Why?\" \"Because part of it was watermelon.\" \"So it was--I noticed it. Well, it does beat all that I never thought about a dog not eating watermelon. It shows how a body can see and don\\'t see at the same time.\" \"Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it again when he came out. He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up from table--same key, I bet. Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner; and it ain\\'t likely there\\'s two prisoners on such a little plantation, and where the people\\'s all so kind and good. Jim\\'s the prisoner. All right--I\\'m glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn\\'t give shucks for any other way. Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to steal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we\\'ll take the one we like the best.\" What a head for just a boy to have! If I had Tom Sawyer\\'s head I wouldn\\'t trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown in a circus, nor nothing I can think of. I went to thinking out a plan, but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from. Pretty soon Tom says: \"Ready?\" \"Yes,\" I says. \"All right--bring it out.\" \"My plan is this,\" I says. \"We can easy find out if it\\'s Jim in there. Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the island. Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old man\\'s britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and Jim used to do before. Wouldn\\'t that plan work?\" \"_Work_? Why, cert\\'nly it would work, like rats a-fighting. But it\\'s too blame\\' simple; there ain\\'t nothing _to_ it. What\\'s the good of a plan that ain\\'t no more trouble than that? It\\'s as mild as goose-milk. Why, Huck, it wouldn\\'t make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory.\" I never said nothing, because I warn\\'t expecting nothing different; but I knowed mighty well that whenever he got _his_ plan ready it wouldn\\'t have none of them objections to it. And it didn\\'t. He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. So I was satisfied, and said we would waltz in on it. I needn\\'t tell what it was here, because I knowed it wouldn\\'t stay the way, it was. I knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance. And that is what he done. Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery. That was the thing that was too many for me. Here was a boy that was respectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at home that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was, without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to this business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame, before everybody. I _couldn\\'t_ understand it no way at all. It was outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be his true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself. And I _did_ start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says: \"Don\\'t you reckon I know what I\\'m about? Don\\'t I generly know what I\\'m about?\" \"Yes.\" \"Didn\\'t I _say_ I was going to help steal the nigger?\" \"Yes.\" \"_Well_, then.\" That\\'s all he said, and that\\'s all I said. It warn\\'t no use to say any more; because when he said he\\'d do a thing, he always done it. But I couldn\\'t make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just let it go, and never bothered no more about it. If he was bound to have it so, I couldn\\'t help it. When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it. We went through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do. They knowed us, and didn\\'t make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in the night. When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides; and on the side I warn\\'t acquainted with--which was the north side--we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just one stout board nailed across it. I says: \"Here\\'s the ticket. This hole\\'s big enough for Jim to get through if we wrench off the board.\" Tom says: \"It\\'s as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as playing hooky. I should _hope_ we can find a way that\\'s a little more complicated than _that_, Huck Finn.\" \"Well, then,\" I says, \"how \\'ll it do to saw him out, the way I done before I was murdered that time?\" \"That\\'s more _like_,\" he says. \"It\\'s real mysterious, and troublesome, and good,\" he says; \"but I bet we can find a way that\\'s twice as long. There ain\\'t no hurry; le\\'s keep on looking around.\" Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank. It was as long as the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide. The door to it was at the south end, and was padlocked. Tom he went to the soap-kettle and searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with; so he took it and prized out one of the staples. The chain fell down, and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match, and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn\\'t no connection with it; and there warn\\'t no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow. The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful. He says; \"Now we\\'re all right. We\\'ll _dig_ him out. It \\'ll take about a week!\" Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door--you only have to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don\\'t fasten the doors--but that warn\\'t romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must climb up the lightning-rod. But after he got up half way about three times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most busted his brains out, he thought he\\'d got to give it up; but after he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this time he made the trip. In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim--if it _was_ Jim that was being fed. The niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim\\'s nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was leaving, the key come from the house. This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches off. He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of strange words and noises, and he didn\\'t believe he was ever witched so long before in his life. He got so worked up, and got to running on so about his troubles, he forgot all about what he\\'d been a-going to do. So Tom says: \"What\\'s the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs?\" The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says: \"Yes, Mars Sid, A dog. Cur\\'us dog, too. Does you want to go en look at \\'im?\" \"Yes.\" I hunched Tom, and whispers: \"You going, right here in the daybreak? _that_ warn\\'t the plan.\" \"No, it warn\\'t; but it\\'s the plan _now_.\" So, drat him, we went along, but I didn\\'t like it much. When we got in we couldn\\'t hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure enough, and could see us; and he sings out: \"Why, _Huck_! En good _lan_\\'! ain\\' dat Misto Tom?\" I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. I didn\\'t know nothing to do; and if I had I couldn\\'t a done it, because that nigger busted in and says: \"Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?\" We could see pretty well now. Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and kind of wondering, and says: \"Does _who_ know us?\" \"Why, dis-yer runaway nigger.\" \"I don\\'t reckon he does; but what put that into your head?\" \"What _put_ it dar? Didn\\' he jis\\' dis minute sing out like he knowed you?\" Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way: \"Well, that\\'s mighty curious. _Who_ sung out? _when_ did he sing out? _what_ did he sing out?\" And turns to me, perfectly ca\\'m, and says, \"Did _you_ hear anybody sing out?\" Of course there warn\\'t nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says: \"No; I ain\\'t heard nobody say nothing.\" Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before, and says: \"Did you sing out?\" \"No, sah,\" says Jim; \"I hain\\'t said nothing, sah.\" \"Not a word?\" \"No, sah, I hain\\'t said a word.\" \"Did you ever see us before?\" \"No, sah; not as I knows on.\" So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and says, kind of severe: \"What do you reckon\\'s the matter with you, anyway? What made you think somebody sung out?\" \"Oh, it\\'s de dad-blame\\' witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do. Dey\\'s awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos\\' kill me, dey sk\\'yers me so. Please to don\\'t tell nobody \\'bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he\\'ll scole me; \\'kase he say dey _ain\\'t_ no witches. I jis\\' wish to goodness he was heah now--_den_ what would he say! I jis\\' bet he couldn\\' fine no way to git aroun\\' it _dis_ time. But it\\'s awluz jis\\' so; people dat\\'s _sot_, stays sot; dey won\\'t look into noth\\'n\\'en fine it out f\\'r deyselves, en when _you_ fine it out en tell um \\'bout it, dey doan\\' b\\'lieve you.\" Tom give him a dime, and said we wouldn\\'t tell nobody; and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and says: \"I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger. If I was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn\\'t give him up, I\\'d hang him.\" And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim and says: \"Don\\'t ever let on to know us. And if you hear any digging going on nights, it\\'s us; we\\'re going to set you free.\" Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger come back, and we said we\\'d come again some time if the nigger wanted us to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because the witches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks around then. ',\n",
              " 'XXXV. IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down into the woods; because Tom said we got to have _some_ light to see how to dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble; what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that\\'s called fox-fire, and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place. We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set down to rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied: \"Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be. And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan. There ain\\'t no watchman to be drugged--now there _ought_ to be a watchman. There ain\\'t even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to. And there\\'s Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his bed: why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain. And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the punkin-headed nigger, and don\\'t send nobody to watch the nigger. Jim could a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn\\'t be no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg. Why, drat it, Huck, it\\'s the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent _all_ the difficulties. Well, we can\\'t help it; we got to do the best we can with the materials we\\'ve got. Anyhow, there\\'s one thing--there\\'s more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers, where there warn\\'t one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your own head. Now look at just that one thing of the lantern. When you come down to the cold facts, we simply got to _let on_ that a lantern\\'s resky. Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to, I believe. Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get.\" \"What do we want of a saw?\" \"What do we _want_ of it? Hain\\'t we got to saw the leg of Jim\\'s bed off, so as to get the chain loose?\" \"Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off.\" \"Well, if that ain\\'t just like you, Huck Finn. You _can_ get up the infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing. Why, hain\\'t you ever read any books at all?--Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chelleeny, nor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes? Who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that? No; the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it just so, and swallow the sawdust, so it can\\'t be found, and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can\\'t see no sign of it\\'s being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound. Then, the night you\\'re ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slip off your chain, and there you are. Nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the moat--because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know--and there\\'s your horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or Navarre, or wherever it is. It\\'s gaudy, Huck. I wish there was a moat to this cabin. If we get time, the night of the escape, we\\'ll dig one.\" I says: \"What do we want of a moat when we\\'re going to snake him out from under the cabin?\" But he never heard me. He had forgot me and everything else. He had his chin in his hand, thinking. Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head; then sighs again, and says: \"No, it wouldn\\'t do--there ain\\'t necessity enough for it.\" \"For what?\" I says. \"Why, to saw Jim\\'s leg off,\" he says. \"Good land!\" I says; \"why, there ain\\'t _no_ necessity for it. And what would you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?\" \"Well, some of the best authorities has done it. They couldn\\'t get the chain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved. And a leg would be better still. But we got to let that go. There ain\\'t necessity enough in this case; and, besides, Jim\\'s a nigger, and wouldn\\'t understand the reasons for it, and how it\\'s the custom in Europe; so we\\'ll let it go. But there\\'s one thing--he can have a rope ladder; we can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough. And we can send it to him in a pie; it\\'s mostly done that way. And I\\'ve et worse pies.\" \"Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk,\" I says; \"Jim ain\\'t got no use for a rope ladder.\" \"He _has_ got use for it. How _you_ talk, you better say; you don\\'t know nothing about it. He\\'s _got_ to have a rope ladder; they all do.\" \"What in the nation can he _do_ with it?\" \"_Do_ with it? He can hide it in his bed, can\\'t he?\" That\\'s what they all do; and _he\\'s_ got to, too. Huck, you don\\'t ever seem to want to do anything that\\'s regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the time. S\\'pose he _don\\'t_ do nothing with it? ain\\'t it there in his bed, for a clew, after he\\'s gone? and don\\'t you reckon they\\'ll want clews? Of course they will. And you wouldn\\'t leave them any? That would be a _pretty_ howdy-do, _wouldn\\'t_ it! I never heard of such a thing.\" \"Well,\" I says, \"if it\\'s in the regulations, and he\\'s got to have it, all right, let him have it; because I don\\'t wish to go back on no regulations; but there\\'s one thing, Tom Sawyer--if we go to tearing up our sheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we\\'re going to get into trouble with Aunt Sally, just as sure as you\\'re born. Now, the way I look at it, a hickry-bark ladder don\\'t cost nothing, and don\\'t waste nothing, and is just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick, as any rag ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he ain\\'t had no experience, and so he don\\'t care what kind of a--\" \"Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I\\'d keep still--that\\'s what I\\'D do. Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickry-bark ladder? Why, it\\'s perfectly ridiculous.\" \"Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you\\'ll take my advice, you\\'ll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline.\" He said that would do. And that gave him another idea, and he says: \"Borrow a shirt, too.\" \"What do we want of a shirt, Tom?\" \"Want it for Jim to keep a journal on.\" \"Journal your granny--_Jim_ can\\'t write.\" \"S\\'pose he _can\\'t_ write--he can make marks on the shirt, can\\'t he, if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron barrel-hoop?\" \"Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one; and quicker, too.\" \"_Prisoners_ don\\'t have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull pens out of, you muggins. They _always_ make their pens out of the hardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on; and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out, too, because they\\'ve got to do it by rubbing it on the wall. _They_ wouldn\\'t use a goose-quill if they had it. It ain\\'t regular.\" \"Well, then, what\\'ll we make him the ink out of?\" \"Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that\\'s the common sort and women; the best authorities uses their own blood. Jim can do that; and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to let the world know where he\\'s captivated, he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window. The Iron Mask always done that, and it\\'s a blame\\' good way, too.\" \"Jim ain\\'t got no tin plates. They feed him in a pan.\" \"That ain\\'t nothing; we can get him some.\" \"Can\\'t nobody _read_ his plates.\" \"That ain\\'t got anything to _do_ with it, Huck Finn. All _he\\'s_ got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out. You don\\'t _have_ to be able to read it. Why, half the time you can\\'t read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate, or anywhere else.\" \"Well, then, what\\'s the sense in wasting the plates?\" \"Why, blame it all, it ain\\'t the _prisoner\\'s_ plates.\" \"But it\\'s _somebody\\'s_ plates, ain\\'t it?\" \"Well, spos\\'n it is? What does the _prisoner_ care whose--\" He broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing. So we cleared out for the house. Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went down and got the fox-fire, and put that in too. I called it borrowing, because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn\\'t borrowing, it was stealing. He said we was representing prisoners; and prisoners don\\'t care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody don\\'t blame them for it, either. It ain\\'t no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it\\'s his right; and so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with. He said if we warn\\'t prisoners it would be a very different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when he warn\\'t a prisoner. So we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy. And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that, when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we _needed_. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon. But he said I didn\\'t need it to get out of prison with; there\\'s where the difference was. He said if I\\'d a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right. So I let it go at that, though I couldn\\'t see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon. Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch. By and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk. He says: \"Everything\\'s all right now except tools; and that\\'s easy fixed.\" \"Tools?\" I says. \"Yes.\" \"Tools for what?\" \"Why, to dig with. We ain\\'t a-going to _gnaw_ him out, are we?\" \"Ain\\'t them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger out with?\" I says. He turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says: \"Huck Finn, did you _ever_ hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels, and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with? Now I want to ask you--if you got any reasonableness in you at all--what kind of a show would _that_ give him to be a hero? Why, they might as well lend him the key and done with it. Picks and shovels--why, they wouldn\\'t furnish \\'em to a king.\" \"Well, then,\" I says, \"if we don\\'t want the picks and shovels, what do we want?\" \"A couple of case-knives.\" \"To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?\" \"Yes.\" \"Confound it, it\\'s foolish, Tom.\" \"It don\\'t make no difference how foolish it is, it\\'s the _right_ way--and it\\'s the regular way. And there ain\\'t no _other_ way, that ever I heard of, and I\\'ve read all the books that gives any information about these things. They always dig out with a case-knife--and not through dirt, mind you; generly it\\'s through solid rock. And it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks, and for ever and ever. Why, look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, that dug himself out that way; how long was _he_ at it, you reckon?\" \"I don\\'t know.\" \"Well, guess.\" \"I don\\'t know. A month and a half.\" \"_Thirty-seven year_--and he come out in China. _That\\'s_ the kind. I wish the bottom of _this_ fortress was solid rock.\" \"_Jim_ don\\'t know nobody in China.\" \"What\\'s _that_ got to do with it? Neither did that other fellow. But you\\'re always a-wandering off on a side issue. Why can\\'t you stick to the main point?\" \"All right--I don\\'t care where he comes out, so he _comes_ out; and Jim don\\'t, either, I reckon. But there\\'s one thing, anyway--Jim\\'s too old to be dug out with a case-knife. He won\\'t last.\" \"Yes he will _last_, too. You don\\'t reckon it\\'s going to take thirty-seven years to dig out through a _dirt_ foundation, do you?\" \"How long will it take, Tom?\" \"Well, we can\\'t resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn\\'t take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans. He\\'ll hear Jim ain\\'t from there. Then his next move will be to advertise Jim, or something like that. So we can\\'t resk being as long digging him out as we ought to. By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years; but we can\\'t. Things being so uncertain, what I recommend is this: that we really dig right in, as quick as we can; and after that, we can _let on_, to ourselves, that we was at it thirty-seven years. Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there\\'s an alarm. Yes, I reckon that \\'ll be the best way.\" \"Now, there\\'s _sense_ in that,\" I says. \"Letting on don\\'t cost nothing; letting on ain\\'t no trouble; and if it\\'s any object, I don\\'t mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year. It wouldn\\'t strain me none, after I got my hand in. So I\\'ll mosey along now, and smouch a couple of case-knives.\" \"Smouch three,\" he says; \"we want one to make a saw out of.\" \"Tom, if it ain\\'t unregular and irreligious to sejest it,\" I says, \"there\\'s an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the weather-boarding behind the smoke-house.\" He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says: \"It ain\\'t no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck. Run along and smouch the knives--three of them.\" So I done it. ',\n",
              " 'XXXVI. AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our pile of fox-fire, and went to work. We cleared everything out of the way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log. Tom said he was right behind Jim\\'s bed now, and we\\'d dig in under it, and when we got through there couldn\\'t nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there, because Jim\\'s counter-pin hung down most to the ground, and you\\'d have to raise it up and look under to see the hole. So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn\\'t see we\\'d done anything hardly. At last I says: \"This ain\\'t no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job, Tom Sawyer.\" He never said nothing. But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking. Then he says: \"It ain\\'t no use, Huck, it ain\\'t a-going to work. If we was prisoners it would, because then we\\'d have as many years as we wanted, and no hurry; and we wouldn\\'t get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn\\'t get blistered, and we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right, and the way it ought to be done. But _we_ can\\'t fool along; we got to rush; we ain\\'t got no time to spare. If we was to put in another night this way we\\'d have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well--couldn\\'t touch a case-knife with them sooner.\" \"Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?\" \"I\\'ll tell you. It ain\\'t right, and it ain\\'t moral, and I wouldn\\'t like it to get out; but there ain\\'t only just the one way: we got to dig him out with the picks, and _let on_ it\\'s case-knives.\" \"_Now_ you\\'re _talking_!\" I says; \"your head gets leveler and leveler all the time, Tom Sawyer,\" I says. \"Picks is the thing, moral or no moral; and as for me, I don\\'t care shucks for the morality of it, nohow. When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school book, I ain\\'t no ways particular how it\\'s done so it\\'s done. What I want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my Sunday-school book; and if a pick\\'s the handiest thing, that\\'s the thing I\\'m a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school book out with; and I don\\'t give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther.\" \"Well,\" he says, \"there\\'s excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like this; if it warn\\'t so, I wouldn\\'t approve of it, nor I wouldn\\'t stand by and see the rules broke--because right is right, and wrong is wrong, and a body ain\\'t got no business doing wrong when he ain\\'t ignorant and knows better. It might answer for _you_ to dig Jim out with a pick, _without_ any letting on, because you don\\'t know no better; but it wouldn\\'t for me, because I do know better. Gimme a case-knife.\" He had his own by him, but I handed him mine. He flung it down, and says: \"Gimme a _case-knife_.\" I didn\\'t know just what to do--but then I thought. I scratched around amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took it and went to work, and never said a word. He was always just that particular. Full of principle. So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about, and made the fur fly. We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing his level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn\\'t come it, his hands was so sore. At last he says: \"It ain\\'t no use, it can\\'t be done. What you reckon I better do? Can\\'t you think of no way?\" \"Yes,\" I says, \"but I reckon it ain\\'t regular. Come up the stairs, and let on it\\'s a lightning-rod.\" So he done it. Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house, for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin plates. Tom says it wasn\\'t enough; but I said nobody wouldn\\'t ever see the plates that Jim throwed out, because they\\'d fall in the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we could tote them back and he could use them over again. So Tom was satisfied. Then he says: \"Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.\" \"Take them in through the hole,\" I says, \"when we get it done.\" He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying. By and by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn\\'t no need to decide on any of them yet. Said we\\'d got to post Jim first. That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn\\'t wake him. Then we whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half the job was done. We crept in under Jim\\'s bed and into the cabin, and pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile, and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle and gradual. He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away, and clearing out without losing any time. But Tom he showed him how unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans, and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_. So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says: \"_Now_ I know how to fix it. We\\'ll send you some things by them.\" I said, \"Don\\'t do nothing of the kind; it\\'s one of the most jackass ideas I ever struck;\" but he never paid no attention to me; went right on. It was his way when he\\'d got his plans set. So he told Jim how we\\'d have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and we would put small things in uncle\\'s coat-pockets and he must steal them out; and we would tie things to aunt\\'s apron-strings or put them in her apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and what they was for. And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with his blood, and all that. He told him everything. Jim he couldn\\'t see no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just as Tom said. Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to bed, with hands that looked like they\\'d been chawed. Tom was in high spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the more he got used to it. He said that in that way it could be strung out to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record. And he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it. In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket. Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat\\'s notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a corn-pone that was in Jim\\'s pan, and we went along with Nat to see how it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out; and there warn\\'t ever anything could a worked better. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only just a piece of rock or something like that that\\'s always getting into bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first. And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim\\'s bed; and they kept on piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn\\'t hardly room in there to get your breath. By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to door! The nigger Nat he only just hollered \"Witches\" once, and keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was dying. Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim\\'s meat, and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back again and shut the door, and I knowed he\\'d fixed the other door too. Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and asking him if he\\'d been imagining he saw something again. He raised up, and blinked his eyes around, and says: \"Mars Sid, you\\'ll say I\\'s a fool, but if I didn\\'t b\\'lieve I see most a million dogs, er devils, er some\\'n, I wisht I may die right heah in dese tracks. I did, mos\\' sholy. Mars Sid, I _felt_ um--I _felt_ um, sah; dey was all over me. Dad fetch it, I jis\\' wisht I could git my han\\'s on one er dem witches jis\\' wunst--on\\'y jis\\' wunst--it\\'s all I\\'d ast. But mos\\'ly I wisht dey\\'d lemme \\'lone, I does.\" Tom says: \"Well, I tell you what I think. What makes them come here just at this runaway nigger\\'s breakfast-time? It\\'s because they\\'re hungry; that\\'s the reason. You make them a witch pie; that\\'s the thing for _you_ to do.\" \"But my lan\\', Mars Sid, how\\'s I gwyne to make \\'m a witch pie? I doan\\' know how to make it. I hain\\'t ever hearn er sich a thing b\\'fo\\'.\" \"Well, then, I\\'ll have to make it myself.\" \"Will you do it, honey?--will you? I\\'ll wusshup de groun\\' und\\' yo\\' foot, I will!\" \"All right, I\\'ll do it, seeing it\\'s you, and you\\'ve been good to us and showed us the runaway nigger. But you got to be mighty careful. When we come around, you turn your back; and then whatever we\\'ve put in the pan, don\\'t you let on you see it at all. And don\\'t you look when Jim unloads the pan--something might happen, I don\\'t know what. And above all, don\\'t you _handle_ the witch-things.\" \"_Hannel \\'M_, Mars Sid? What _is_ you a-talkin\\' \\'bout? I wouldn\\' lay de weight er my finger on um, not f\\'r ten hund\\'d thous\\'n billion dollars, I wouldn\\'t.\" ',\n",
              " 'XXXVII. THAT was all fixed. So then we went away and went to the rubbage-pile in the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags, and pieces of bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and scratched around and found an old tin washpan, and stopped up the holes as well as we could, to bake the pie in, and took it down cellar and stole it full of flour and started for breakfast, and found a couple of shingle-nails that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in Aunt Sally\\'s apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t\\'other we stuck in the band of Uncle Silas\\'s hat, which was on the bureau, because we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger\\'s house this morning, and then went to breakfast, and Tom dropped the pewter spoon in Uncle Silas\\'s coat-pocket, and Aunt Sally wasn\\'t come yet, so we had to wait a little while. And when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn\\'t hardly wait for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand and cracking the handiest child\\'s head with her thimble with the other, and says: \"I\\'ve hunted high and I\\'ve hunted low, and it does beat all what _has_ become of your other shirt.\" My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard piece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the road with a cough, and was shot across the table, and took one of the children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm, and let a cry out of him the size of a warwhoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue around the gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for about a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would a sold out for half price if there was a bidder. But after that we was all right again--it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold. Uncle Silas he says: \"It\\'s most uncommon curious, I can\\'t understand it. I know perfectly well I took it _off_, because--\" \"Because you hain\\'t got but one _on_. Just _listen_ at the man! I know you took it off, and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering memory, too, because it was on the clo\\'s-line yesterday--I see it there myself. But it\\'s gone, that\\'s the long and the short of it, and you\\'ll just have to change to a red flann\\'l one till I can get time to make a new one. And it \\'ll be the third I\\'ve made in two years. It just keeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to _do_ with \\'m all is more\\'n I can make out. A body \\'d think you _would_ learn to take some sort of care of \\'em at your time of life.\" \"I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can. But it oughtn\\'t to be altogether my fault, because, you know, I don\\'t see them nor have nothing to do with them except when they\\'re on me; and I don\\'t believe I\\'ve ever lost one of them _off_ of me.\" \"Well, it ain\\'t _your_ fault if you haven\\'t, Silas; you\\'d a done it if you could, I reckon. And the shirt ain\\'t all that\\'s gone, nuther. Ther\\'s a spoon gone; and _that_ ain\\'t all. There was ten, and now ther\\'s only nine. The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf never took the spoon, _that\\'s_ certain.\" \"Why, what else is gone, Sally?\" \"Ther\\'s six _candles_ gone--that\\'s what. The rats could a got the candles, and I reckon they did; I wonder they don\\'t walk off with the whole place, the way you\\'re always going to stop their holes and don\\'t do it; and if they warn\\'t fools they\\'d sleep in your hair, Silas--_you\\'d_ never find it out; but you can\\'t lay the _spoon_ on the rats, and that I know.\" \"Well, Sally, I\\'m in fault, and I acknowledge it; I\\'ve been remiss; but I won\\'t let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes.\" \"Oh, I wouldn\\'t hurry; next year \\'ll do. Matilda Angelina Araminta _Phelps!_\" Whack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the sugar-bowl without fooling around any. Just then the nigger woman steps on to the passage, and says: \"Missus, dey\\'s a sheet gone.\" \"A _sheet_ gone! Well, for the land\\'s sake!\" \"I\\'ll stop up them holes to-day,\" says Uncle Silas, looking sorrowful. \"Oh, _do_ shet up!--s\\'pose the rats took the _sheet_? _where\\'s_ it gone, Lize?\" \"Clah to goodness I hain\\'t no notion, Miss\\' Sally. She wuz on de clo\\'sline yistiddy, but she done gone: she ain\\' dah no mo\\' now.\" \"I reckon the world _is_ coming to an end. I _never_ see the beat of it in all my born days. A shirt, and a sheet, and a spoon, and six can--\" \"Missus,\" comes a young yaller wench, \"dey\\'s a brass cannelstick miss\\'n.\" \"Cler out from here, you hussy, er I\\'ll take a skillet to ye!\" Well, she was just a-biling. I begun to lay for a chance; I reckoned I would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated. She kept a-raging right along, running her insurrection all by herself, and everybody else mighty meek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, looking kind of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his pocket. She stopped, with her mouth open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I was in Jeruslem or somewheres. But not long, because she says: \"It\\'s _just_ as I expected. So you had it in your pocket all the time; and like as not you\\'ve got the other things there, too. How\\'d it get there?\" \"I reely don\\'t know, Sally,\" he says, kind of apologizing, \"or you know I would tell. I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before breakfast, and I reckon I put it in there, not noticing, meaning to put my Testament in, and it must be so, because my Testament ain\\'t in; but I\\'ll go and see; and if the Testament is where I had it, I\\'ll know I didn\\'t put it in, and that will show that I laid the Testament down and took up the spoon, and--\" \"Oh, for the land\\'s sake! Give a body a rest! Go \\'long now, the whole kit and biling of ye; and don\\'t come nigh me again till I\\'ve got back my peace of mind.\" I\\'D a heard her if she\\'d a said it to herself, let alone speaking it out; and I\\'d a got up and obeyed her if I\\'d a been dead. As we was passing through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat, and the shingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just merely picked it up and laid it on the mantel-shelf, and never said nothing, and went out. Tom see him do it, and remembered about the spoon, and says: \"Well, it ain\\'t no use to send things by _him_ no more, he ain\\'t reliable.\" Then he says: \"But he done us a good turn with the spoon, anyway, without knowing it, and so we\\'ll go and do him one without _him_ knowing it--stop up his rat-holes.\" There was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a whole hour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape. Then we heard steps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here comes the old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t\\'other, looking as absent-minded as year before last. He went a mooning around, first to one rat-hole and then another, till he\\'d been to them all. Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off of his candle and thinking. Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs, saying: \"Well, for the life of me I can\\'t remember when I done it. I could show her now that I warn\\'t to blame on account of the rats. But never mind--let it go. I reckon it wouldn\\'t do no good.\" And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left. He was a mighty nice old man. And always is. Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said we\\'d got to have it; so he took a think. When he had ciphered it out he told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of them up my sleeve, and Tom says: \"Why, Aunt Sally, there ain\\'t but nine spoons _yet_.\" She says: \"Go \\'long to your play, and don\\'t bother me. I know better, I counted \\'m myself.\" \"Well, I\\'ve counted them twice, Aunty, and I can\\'t make but nine.\" She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count--anybody would. \"I declare to gracious ther\\' _ain\\'t_ but nine!\" she says. \"Why, what in the world--plague _take_ the things, I\\'ll count \\'m again.\" So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she says: \"Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther\\'s _ten_ now!\" and she looked huffy and bothered both. But Tom says: \"Why, Aunty, I don\\'t think there\\'s ten.\" \"You numskull, didn\\'t you see me _count \\'m?_\" \"I know, but--\" \"Well, I\\'ll count \\'m _again_.\" So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time. Well, she _was_ in a tearing way--just a-trembling all over, she was so mad. But she counted and counted till she got that addled she\\'d start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they come out right, and three times they come out wrong. Then she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley-west; and she said cle\\'r out and let her have some peace, and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she\\'d skin us. So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along with her shingle nail, before noon. We was very well satisfied with this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took, because he said _now_ she couldn\\'t ever count them spoons twice alike again to save her life; and wouldn\\'t believe she\\'d counted them right if she _did_; and said that after she\\'d about counted her head off for the next three days he judged she\\'d give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever count them any more. So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of days till she didn\\'t know how many sheets she had any more, and she didn\\'t _care_, and warn\\'t a-going to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it, and wouldn\\'t count them again not to save her life; she druther die first. So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn\\'t no consequence, it would blow over by and by. But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. We fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with the smoke; because, you see, we didn\\'t want nothing but a crust, and we couldn\\'t prop it up right, and she would always cave in. But of course we thought of the right way at last--which was to cook the ladder, too, in the pie. So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with. We let on it took nine months to make it. And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn\\'t go into the pie. Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope enough for forty pies if we\\'d a wanted them, and plenty left over for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose. We could a had a whole dinner. But we didn\\'t need it. All we needed was just enough for the pie, and so we throwed the rest away. We didn\\'t cook none of the pies in the wash-pan--afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things that was valuable, not on account of being any account, because they warn\\'t, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first pies, because we didn\\'t know how, but she come up smiling on the last one. We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope ladder wouldn\\'t cramp him down to business I don\\'t know nothing what I\\'m talking about, and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next time, too. Nat didn\\'t look when we put the witch pie in Jim\\'s pan; and we put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so Jim got everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he busted into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick, and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window-hole. ',\n",
              " 'XXXVIII. MAKING them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all. That\\'s the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. But he had to have it; Tom said he\\'d _got_ to; there warn\\'t no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms. \"Look at Lady Jane Grey,\" he says; \"look at Gilford Dudley; look at old Northumberland! Why, Huck, s\\'pose it _is_ considerble trouble?--what you going to do?--how you going to get around it? Jim\\'s _got_ to do his inscription and coat of arms. They all do.\" Jim says: \"Why, Mars Tom, I hain\\'t got no coat o\\' arm; I hain\\'t got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.\" \"Oh, you don\\'t understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different.\" \"Well,\" I says, \"Jim\\'s right, anyway, when he says he ain\\'t got no coat of arms, because he hain\\'t.\" \"I reckon I knowed that,\" Tom says, \"but you bet he\\'ll have one before he goes out of this--because he\\'s going out _right_, and there ain\\'t going to be no flaws in his record.\" So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim a-making his\\'n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon, Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms. By and by he said he\\'d struck so many good ones he didn\\'t hardly know which to take, but there was one which he reckoned he\\'d decide on. He says: \"On the scutcheon we\\'ll have a bend _or_ in the dexter base, a saltire _murrey_ in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under his foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron _vert_ in a chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field _azure_, with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger, _sable_, with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a couple of gules for supporters, which is you and me; motto, _Maggiore Fretta, Minore Otto._ Got it out of a book--means the more haste the less speed.\" \"Geewhillikins,\" I says, \"but what does the rest of it mean?\" \"We ain\\'t got no time to bother over that,\" he says; \"we got to dig in like all git-out.\" \"Well, anyway,\" I says, \"what\\'s _some_ of it? What\\'s a fess?\" \"A fess--a fess is--_you_ don\\'t need to know what a fess is. I\\'ll show him how to make it when he gets to it.\" \"Shucks, Tom,\" I says, \"I think you might tell a person. What\\'s a bar sinister?\" \"Oh, I don\\'t know. But he\\'s got to have it. All the nobility does.\" That was just his way. If it didn\\'t suit him to explain a thing to you, he wouldn\\'t do it. You might pump at him a week, it wouldn\\'t make no difference. He\\'d got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in to finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a mournful inscription--said Jim got to have one, like they all done. He made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so: 1. Here a captive heart busted. 2. Here a poor prisoner, forsook by the world and friends, fretted his sorrowful life. 3. Here a lonely heart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after thirty-seven years of solitary captivity. 4. Here, homeless and friendless, after thirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger, natural son of Louis XIV. Tom\\'s voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down. When he got done he couldn\\'t no way make up his mind which one for Jim to scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he allowed he would let him scrabble them all on. Jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail, and he didn\\'t know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said he would block them out for him, and then he wouldn\\'t have nothing to do but just follow the lines. Then pretty soon he says: \"Come to think, the logs ain\\'t a-going to do; they don\\'t have log walls in a dungeon: we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock. We\\'ll fetch a rock.\" Jim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn\\'t ever get out. But Tom said he would let me help him do it. Then he took a look to see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens. It was most pesky tedious hard work and slow, and didn\\'t give my hands no show to get well of the sores, and we didn\\'t seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tom says: \"I know how to fix it. We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and mournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock. There\\'s a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we\\'ll smouch it, and carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it, too.\" It warn\\'t no slouch of an idea; and it warn\\'t no slouch of a grindstone nuther; but we allowed we\\'d tackle it. It warn\\'t quite midnight yet, so we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work. We smouched the grindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was a most nation tough job. Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn\\'t keep her from falling over, and she come mighty near mashing us every time. Tom said she was going to get one of us, sure, before we got through. We got her half way; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat. We see it warn\\'t no use; we got to go and fetch Jim. So he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round his neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and Jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing; and Tom superintended. He could out-superintend any boy I ever see. He knowed how to do everything. Our hole was pretty big, but it warn\\'t big enough to get the grindstone through; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough. Then Tom marked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work on them, with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the lean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his candle quit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it. Then we helped him fix his chain back on the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves. But Tom thought of something, and says: \"You got any spiders in here, Jim?\" \"No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain\\'t, Mars Tom.\" \"All right, we\\'ll get you some.\" \"But bless you, honey, I doan\\' _want_ none. I\\'s afeard un um. I jis\\' \\'s soon have rattlesnakes aroun\\'.\" Tom thought a minute or two, and says: \"It\\'s a good idea. And I reckon it\\'s been done. It _must_ a been done; it stands to reason. Yes, it\\'s a prime good idea. Where could you keep it?\" \"Keep what, Mars Tom?\" \"Why, a rattlesnake.\" \"De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom! Why, if dey was a rattlesnake to come in heah I\\'d take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid my head.\" \"Why, Jim, you wouldn\\'t be afraid of it after a little. You could tame it.\" \"_Tame_ it!\" \"Yes--easy enough. Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting, and they wouldn\\'t _think_ of hurting a person that pets them. Any book will tell you that. You try--that\\'s all I ask; just try for two or three days. Why, you can get him so, in a little while, that he\\'ll love you; and sleep with you; and won\\'t stay away from you a minute; and will let you wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth.\" \"_Please_, Mars Tom--_doan_\\' talk so! I can\\'t _stan_\\' it! He\\'d _let_ me shove his head in my mouf--fer a favor, hain\\'t it? I lay he\\'d wait a pow\\'ful long time \\'fo\\' I _ast_ him. En mo\\' en dat, I doan\\' _want_ him to sleep wid me.\" \"Jim, don\\'t act so foolish. A prisoner\\'s _got_ to have some kind of a dumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain\\'t ever been tried, why, there\\'s more glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way you could ever think of to save your life.\" \"Why, Mars Tom, I doan\\' _want_ no sich glory. Snake take \\'n bite Jim\\'s chin off, den _whah_ is de glory? No, sah, I doan\\' want no sich doin\\'s.\" \"Blame it, can\\'t you _try_? I only _want_ you to try--you needn\\'t keep it up if it don\\'t work.\" \"But de trouble all _done_ ef de snake bite me while I\\'s a tryin\\' him. Mars Tom, I\\'s willin\\' to tackle mos\\' anything \\'at ain\\'t onreasonable, but ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I\\'s gwyne to _leave_, dat\\'s _shore_.\" \"Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you\\'re so bull-headed about it. We can get you some garter-snakes, and you can tie some buttons on their tails, and let on they\\'re rattlesnakes, and I reckon that \\'ll have to do.\" \"I k\\'n stan\\' _dem_, Mars Tom, but blame\\' \\'f I couldn\\' get along widout um, I tell you dat. I never knowed b\\'fo\\' \\'t was so much bother and trouble to be a prisoner.\" \"Well, it _always_ is when it\\'s done right. You got any rats around here?\" \"No, sah, I hain\\'t seed none.\" \"Well, we\\'ll get you some rats.\" \"Why, Mars Tom, I doan\\' _want_ no rats. Dey\\'s de dadblamedest creturs to \\'sturb a body, en rustle roun\\' over \\'im, en bite his feet, when he\\'s tryin\\' to sleep, I ever see. No, sah, gimme g\\'yarter-snakes, \\'f I\\'s got to have \\'m, but doan\\' gimme no rats; I hain\\' got no use f\\'r um, skasely.\" \"But, Jim, you _got_ to have \\'em--they all do. So don\\'t make no more fuss about it. Prisoners ain\\'t ever without rats. There ain\\'t no instance of it. And they train them, and pet them, and learn them tricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies. But you got to play music to them. You got anything to play music on?\" \"I ain\\' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o\\' paper, en a juice-harp; but I reck\\'n dey wouldn\\' take no stock in a juice-harp.\" \"Yes they would _they_ don\\'t care what kind of music \\'tis. A jews-harp\\'s plenty good enough for a rat. All animals like music--in a prison they dote on it. Specially, painful music; and you can\\'t get no other kind out of a jews-harp. It always interests them; they come out to see what\\'s the matter with you. Yes, you\\'re all right; you\\'re fixed very well. You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep, and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play \\'The Last Link is Broken\\'--that\\'s the thing that \\'ll scoop a rat quicker \\'n anything else; and when you\\'ve played about two minutes you\\'ll see all the rats, and the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you, and come. And they\\'ll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good time.\" \"Yes, _dey_ will, I reck\\'n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is _Jim_ havin\\'? Blest if I kin see de pint. But I\\'ll do it ef I got to. I reck\\'n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in de house.\" Tom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn\\'t nothing else; and pretty soon he says: \"Oh, there\\'s one thing I forgot. Could you raise a flower here, do you reckon?\" \"I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it\\'s tolable dark in heah, en I ain\\' got no use f\\'r no flower, nohow, en she\\'d be a pow\\'ful sight o\\' trouble.\" \"Well, you try it, anyway. Some other prisoners has done it.\" \"One er dem big cat-tail-lookin\\' mullen-stalks would grow in heah, Mars Tom, I reck\\'n, but she wouldn\\'t be wuth half de trouble she\\'d coss.\" \"Don\\'t you believe it. We\\'ll fetch you a little one and you plant it in the corner over there, and raise it. And don\\'t call it mullen, call it Pitchiola--that\\'s its right name when it\\'s in a prison. And you want to water it with your tears.\" \"Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom.\" \"You don\\'t _want_ spring water; you want to water it with your tears. It\\'s the way they always do.\" \"Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid spring water whiles another man\\'s a _start\\'n_ one wid tears.\" \"That ain\\'t the idea. You _got_ to do it with tears.\" \"She\\'ll die on my han\\'s, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan\\' skasely ever cry.\" So Tom was stumped. But he studied it over, and then said Jim would have to worry along the best he could with an onion. He promised he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim\\'s coffee-pot, in the morning. Jim said he would \"jis\\' \\'s soon have tobacker in his coffee;\" and found so much fault with it, and with the work and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of all the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals, and things, which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tom most lost all patience with him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself, and yet he didn\\'t know enough to appreciate them, and they was just about wasted on him. So Jim he was sorry, and said he wouldn\\'t behave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed. ',\n",
              " 'XXXIX. IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put it in a safe place under Aunt Sally\\'s bed. But while we was gone for spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out, and they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her. So she took and dusted us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn\\'t the likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock. I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was. We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet\\'s nest, but we didn\\'t. The family was at home. We didn\\'t give it right up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we\\'d tire them out or they\\'d got to tire us out, and they done it. Then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right again, but couldn\\'t set down convenient. And so we went for the snakes, and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and a rattling good honest day\\'s work: and hungry?--oh, no, I reckon not! And there warn\\'t a blessed snake up there when we went back--we didn\\'t half tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left. But it didn\\'t matter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres. So we judged we could get some of them again. No, there warn\\'t no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell. You\\'d see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they generly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most of the time where you didn\\'t want them. Well, they was handsome and striped, and there warn\\'t no harm in a million of them; but that never made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what they might, and she couldn\\'t stand them no way you could fix it; and every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn\\'t make no difference what she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out. I never see such a woman. And you could hear her whoop to Jericho. You couldn\\'t get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs. And if she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire. She disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there hadn\\'t ever been no snakes created. Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn\\'t over it yet; she warn\\'t near over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings. It was very curious. But Tom said all women was just so. He said they was made that way for some reason or other. We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she allowed these lickings warn\\'t nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them. I didn\\'t mind the lickings, because they didn\\'t amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot. But we got them laid in, and all the other things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim\\'s was when they\\'d all swarm out for music and go for him. Jim didn\\'t like the spiders, and the spiders didn\\'t like Jim; and so they\\'d lay for him, and make it mighty warm for him. And he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there warn\\'t no room in bed for him, skasely; and when there was, a body couldn\\'t sleep, it was so lively, and it was always lively, he said, because _they_ never all slept at one time, but took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one gang under him, in his way, and t\\'other gang having a circus over him, and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over. He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn\\'t ever be a prisoner again, not for a salary. Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape. The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh; the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust, and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache. We reckoned we was all going to die, but didn\\'t. It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever see; and Tom said the same. But as I was saying, we\\'d got all the work done now, at last; and we was all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim. The old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their runaway nigger, but hadn\\'t got no answer, because there warn\\'t no such plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me the cold shivers, and I see we hadn\\'t no time to lose. So Tom said, now for the nonnamous letters. \"What\\'s them?\" I says. \"Warnings to the people that something is up. Sometimes it\\'s done one way, sometimes another. But there\\'s always somebody spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle. When Louis XVI. was going to light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it. It\\'s a very good way, and so is the nonnamous letters. We\\'ll use them both. And it\\'s usual for the prisoner\\'s mother to change clothes with him, and she stays in, and he slides out in her clothes. We\\'ll do that, too.\" \"But looky here, Tom, what do we want to _warn_ anybody for that something\\'s up? Let them find it out for themselves--it\\'s their lookout.\" \"Yes, I know; but you can\\'t depend on them. It\\'s the way they\\'ve acted from the very start--left us to do _everything_. They\\'re so confiding and mullet-headed they don\\'t take notice of nothing at all. So if we don\\'t _give_ them notice there won\\'t be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape \\'ll go off perfectly flat; won\\'t amount to nothing--won\\'t be nothing _to_ it.\" \"Well, as for me, Tom, that\\'s the way I\\'d like.\" \"Shucks!\" he says, and looked disgusted. So I says: \"But I ain\\'t going to make no complaint. Any way that suits you suits me. What you going to do about the servant-girl?\" \"You\\'ll be her. You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook that yaller girl\\'s frock.\" \"Why, Tom, that \\'ll make trouble next morning; because, of course, she prob\\'bly hain\\'t got any but that one.\" \"I know; but you don\\'t want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door.\" \"All right, then, I\\'ll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my own togs.\" \"You wouldn\\'t look like a servant-girl _then_, would you?\" \"No, but there won\\'t be nobody to see what I look like, _anyway_.\" \"That ain\\'t got nothing to do with it. The thing for us to do is just to do our _duty_, and not worry about whether anybody _sees_ us do it or not. Hain\\'t you got no principle at all?\" \"All right, I ain\\'t saying nothing; I\\'m the servant-girl. Who\\'s Jim\\'s mother?\" \"I\\'m his mother. I\\'ll hook a gown from Aunt Sally.\" \"Well, then, you\\'ll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves.\" \"Not much. I\\'ll stuff Jim\\'s clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed to represent his mother in disguise, and Jim \\'ll take the nigger woman\\'s gown off of me and wear it, and we\\'ll all evade together. When a prisoner of style escapes it\\'s called an evasion. It\\'s always called so when a king escapes, f\\'rinstance. And the same with a king\\'s son; it don\\'t make no difference whether he\\'s a natural one or an unnatural one.\" So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench\\'s frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the way Tom told me to. It said: Beware. Trouble is brewing. Keep a sharp lookout. _Unknown_ _Friend_. Next night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and crossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on the back door. I never see a family in such a sweat. They couldn\\'t a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air. If a door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said \"ouch!\" if anything fell, she jumped and said \"ouch!\" if you happened to touch her, when she warn\\'t noticing, she done the same; she couldn\\'t face noway and be satisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her every time--so she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying \"ouch,\" and before she\\'d got two-thirds around she\\'d whirl back again, and say it again; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn\\'t set up. So the thing was working very well, Tom said; he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory. He said it showed it was done right. So he said, now for the grand bulge! So the very next morning at the streak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we better do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night. Tom he went down the lightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep, and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back. This letter said: Don\\'t betray me, I wish to be your friend. There is a desprate gang of cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway nigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you will stay in the house and not bother them. I am one of the gang, but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again, and will betray the helish design. They will sneak down from northards, along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the nigger\\'s cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any danger; but stead of that I will _baa_ like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his chains loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your leasure. Don\\'t do anything but just the way I am telling you, if you do they will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish any reward but to know I have done the right thing. _Unknown Friend._ ',\n",
              " 'XL. WE was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went over the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took a look at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper, and found them in such a sweat and worry they didn\\'t know which end they was standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done supper, and wouldn\\'t tell us what the trouble was, and never let on a word about the new letter, but didn\\'t need to, because we knowed as much about it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about half-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally\\'s dress that he stole and was going to start with the lunch, but says: \"Where\\'s the butter?\" \"I laid out a hunk of it,\" I says, \"on a piece of a corn-pone.\" \"Well, you _left_ it laid out, then--it ain\\'t here.\" \"We can get along without it,\" I says. \"We can get along _with_ it, too,\" he says; \"just you slide down cellar and fetch it. And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come along. I\\'ll go and stuff the straw into Jim\\'s clothes to represent his mother in disguise, and be ready to _baa_ like a sheep and shove soon as you get there.\" So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as a person\\'s fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of corn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs very stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes Aunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped my hat on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says: \"You been down cellar?\" \"Yes\\'m.\" \"What you been doing down there?\" \"Noth\\'n.\" \"_Noth\\'n!_\" \"No\\'m.\" \"Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?\" \"I don\\'t know \\'m.\" \"You don\\'t _know_? Don\\'t answer me that way. Tom, I want to know what you been _doing_ down there.\" \"I hain\\'t been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if I have.\" I reckoned she\\'d let me go now, and as a generl thing she would; but I s\\'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat about every little thing that warn\\'t yard-stick straight; so she says, very decided: \"You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come. You been up to something you no business to, and I lay I\\'ll find out what it is before I\\'M done with you.\" So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room. My, but there was a crowd there! Fifteen farmers, and every one of them had a gun. I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down. They was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low voice, and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they warn\\'t; but I knowed they was, because they was always taking off their hats, and putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their seats, and fumbling with their buttons. I warn\\'t easy myself, but I didn\\'t take my hat off, all the same. I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if she wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we\\'d overdone this thing, and what a thundering hornet\\'s-nest we\\'d got ourselves into, so we could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with Jim before these rips got out of patience and come for us. At last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I _couldn\\'t_ answer them straight, I didn\\'t know which end of me was up; because these men was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and lay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn\\'t but a few minutes to midnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheep-signal; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions, and me a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was that scared; and the place getting hotter and hotter, and the butter beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears; and pretty soon, when one of them says, \"I\\'M for going and getting in the cabin _first_ and right _now_, and catching them when they come,\" I most dropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead, and Aunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says: \"For the land\\'s sake, what _is_ the matter with the child? He\\'s got the brain-fever as shore as you\\'re born, and they\\'re oozing out!\" And everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out comes the bread and what was left of the butter, and she grabbed me, and hugged me, and says: \"Oh, what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful I am it ain\\'t no worse; for luck\\'s against us, and it never rains but it pours, and when I see that truck I thought we\\'d lost you, for I knowed by the color and all it was just like your brains would be if--Dear, dear, whyd\\'nt you _tell_ me that was what you\\'d been down there for, I wouldn\\'t a cared. Now cler out to bed, and don\\'t lemme see no more of you till morning!\" I was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one, and shinning through the dark for the lean-to. I couldn\\'t hardly get my words out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could we must jump for it now, and not a minute to lose--the house full of men, yonder, with guns! His eyes just blazed; and he says: \"No!--is that so? _ain\\'t_ it bully! Why, Huck, if it was to do over again, I bet I could fetch two hundred! If we could put it off till--\" \"Hurry! _Hurry_!\" I says. \"Where\\'s Jim?\" \"Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him. He\\'s dressed, and everything\\'s ready. Now we\\'ll slide out and give the sheep-signal.\" But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them begin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say: \"I _told_ you we\\'d be too soon; they haven\\'t come--the door is locked. Here, I\\'ll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for \\'em in the dark and kill \\'em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece, and listen if you can hear \\'em coming.\" So in they come, but couldn\\'t see us in the dark, and most trod on us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed. But we got under all right, and out through the hole, swift but soft--Jim first, me next, and Tom last, which was according to Tom\\'s orders. Now we was in the lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside. So we crept to the door, and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn\\'t make out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out first, and him last. So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down, not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim over it; but Tom\\'s britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out: \"Who\\'s that? Answer, or I\\'ll shoot!\" But we didn\\'t answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved. Then there was a rush, and a _Bang, Bang, Bang!_ and the bullets fairly whizzed around us! We heard them sing out: \"Here they are! They\\'ve broke for the river! After \\'em, boys, and turn loose the dogs!\" So here they come, full tilt. We could hear them because they wore boots and yelled, but we didn\\'t wear no boots and didn\\'t yell. We was in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind them. They\\'d had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn\\'t scare off the robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they come, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn\\'t nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and then we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river, but didn\\'t make no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then we struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out. And when we stepped on to the raft I says: \"_Now_, old Jim, you\\'re a free man again, and I bet you won\\'t ever be a slave no more.\" \"En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck. It \\'uz planned beautiful, en it \\'uz done beautiful; en dey ain\\'t _nobody_ kin git up a plan dat\\'s mo\\' mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz.\" We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg. When me and Jim heard that we didn\\'t feel so brash as what we did before. It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke\\'s shirts for to bandage him, but he says: \"Gimme the rags; I can do it myself. Don\\'t stop now; don\\'t fool around here, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and set her loose! Boys, we done it elegant!--\\'deed we did. I wish _we\\'d_ a had the handling of Louis XVI., there wouldn\\'t a been no \\'Son of Saint Louis, ascend to heaven!\\' wrote down in _his_ biography; no, sir, we\\'d a whooped him over the _border_--that\\'s what we\\'d a done with _him_--and done it just as slick as nothing at all, too. Man the sweeps--man the sweeps!\" But me and Jim was consulting--and thinking. And after we\\'d thought a minute, I says: \"Say it, Jim.\" So he says: \"Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck. Ef it wuz _him_ dat \\'uz bein\\' sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, \\'Go on en save me, nemmine \\'bout a doctor f\\'r to save dis one?\\' Is dat like Mars Tom Sawyer? Would he say dat? You _bet_ he wouldn\\'t! _well_, den, is _Jim_ gywne to say it? No, sah--I doan\\' budge a step out\\'n dis place \\'dout a _doctor_, not if it\\'s forty year!\" I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he\\'d say what he did say--so it was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor. He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and wouldn\\'t budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself; but we wouldn\\'t let him. Then he give us a piece of his mind, but it didn\\'t do no good. So when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says: \"Well, then, if you\\'re bound to go, I\\'ll tell you the way to do when you get to the village. Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and fast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse full of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him here in the canoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him and take his chalk away from him, and don\\'t give it back to him till you get him back to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again. It\\'s the way they all do.\" So I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he see the doctor coming till he was gone again. ',\n",
              " 'XLI. THE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got him up. I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to come home this evening and surprise the folks. \"Who is your folks?\" he says. \"The Phelpses, down yonder.\" \"Oh,\" he says. And after a minute, he says: \"How\\'d you say he got shot?\" \"He had a dream,\" I says, \"and it shot him.\" \"Singular dream,\" he says. So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started. But when he sees the canoe he didn\\'t like the look of her--said she was big enough for one, but didn\\'t look pretty safe for two. I says: \"Oh, you needn\\'t be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy enough.\" \"What three?\" \"Why, me and Sid, and--and--and _the guns_; that\\'s what I mean.\" \"Oh,\" he says. But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head, and said he reckoned he\\'d look around for a bigger one. But they was all locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait till he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better go down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to. But I said I didn\\'t; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he started. I struck an idea pretty soon. I says to myself, spos\\'n he can\\'t fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheep\\'s tail, as the saying is? spos\\'n it takes him three or four days? What are we going to do?--lay around there till he lets the cat out of the bag? No, sir; I know what _I\\'ll_ do. I\\'ll wait, and when he comes back if he says he\\'s got to go any more I\\'ll get down there, too, if I swim; and we\\'ll take and tie him, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom\\'s done with him we\\'ll give him what it\\'s worth, or all we got, and then let him get ashore. So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I waked up the sun was away up over my head! I shot out and went for the doctor\\'s house, but they told me he\\'d gone away in the night some time or other, and warn\\'t back yet. Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad for Tom, and I\\'ll dig out for the island right off. So away I shoved, and turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas\\'s stomach! He says: \"Why, _Tom!_ Where you been all this time, you rascal?\" \"I hain\\'t been nowheres,\" I says, \"only just hunting for the runaway nigger--me and Sid.\" \"Why, where ever did you go?\" he says. \"Your aunt\\'s been mighty uneasy.\" \"She needn\\'t,\" I says, \"because we was all right. We followed the men and the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we heard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over, but couldn\\'t find nothing of them; so we cruised along up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe and went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we paddled over here to hear the news, and Sid\\'s at the post-office to see what he can hear, and I\\'m a-branching out to get something to eat for us, and then we\\'re going home.\" So then we went to the post-office to get \"Sid\"; but just as I suspicioned, he warn\\'t there; so the old man he got a letter out of the office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn\\'t come; so the old man said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got done fooling around--but we would ride. I couldn\\'t get him to let me stay and wait for Sid; and he said there warn\\'t no use in it, and I must come along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right. When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that don\\'t amount to shucks, and said she\\'d serve Sid the same when he come. And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers\\' wives, to dinner; and such another clack a body never heard. Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the worst; her tongue was a-going all the time. She says: \"Well, Sister Phelps, I\\'ve ransacked that-air cabin over, an\\' I b\\'lieve the nigger was crazy. I says to Sister Damrell--didn\\'t I, Sister Damrell?--s\\'I, he\\'s crazy, s\\'I--them\\'s the very words I said. You all hearn me: he\\'s crazy, s\\'I; everything shows it, s\\'I. Look at that-air grindstone, s\\'I; want to tell _me_\\'t any cretur \\'t\\'s in his right mind \\'s a goin\\' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a grindstone, s\\'I? Here sich \\'n\\' sich a person busted his heart; \\'n\\' here so \\'n\\' so pegged along for thirty-seven year, \\'n\\' all that--natcherl son o\\' Louis somebody, \\'n\\' sich everlast\\'n rubbage. He\\'s plumb crazy, s\\'I; it\\'s what I says in the fust place, it\\'s what I says in the middle, \\'n\\' it\\'s what I says last \\'n\\' all the time--the nigger\\'s crazy--crazy \\'s Nebokoodneezer, s\\'I.\" \"An\\' look at that-air ladder made out\\'n rags, Sister Hotchkiss,\" says old Mrs. Damrell; \"what in the name o\\' goodness _could_ he ever want of--\" \"The very words I was a-sayin\\' no longer ago th\\'n this minute to Sister Utterback, \\'n\\' she\\'ll tell you so herself. Sh-she, look at that-air rag ladder, sh-she; \\'n\\' s\\'I, yes, _look_ at it, s\\'I--what _could_ he a-wanted of it, s\\'I. Sh-she, Sister Hotchkiss, sh-she--\" \"But how in the nation\\'d they ever _git_ that grindstone _in_ there, _anyway_? \\'n\\' who dug that-air _hole_? \\'n\\' who--\" \"My very _words_, Brer Penrod! I was a-sayin\\'--pass that-air sasser o\\' m\\'lasses, won\\'t ye?--I was a-sayin\\' to Sister Dunlap, jist this minute, how _did_ they git that grindstone in there, s\\'I. Without _help_, mind you--\\'thout _help_! _that\\'s_ wher \\'tis. Don\\'t tell _me_, s\\'I; there _wuz_ help, s\\'I; \\'n\\' ther\\' wuz a _plenty_ help, too, s\\'I; ther\\'s ben a _dozen_ a-helpin\\' that nigger, \\'n\\' I lay I\\'d skin every last nigger on this place but _I\\'d_ find out who done it, s\\'I; \\'n\\' moreover, s\\'I--\" \"A _dozen_ says you!--_forty_ couldn\\'t a done every thing that\\'s been done. Look at them case-knife saws and things, how tedious they\\'ve been made; look at that bed-leg sawed off with \\'m, a week\\'s work for six men; look at that nigger made out\\'n straw on the bed; and look at--\" \"You may _well_ say it, Brer Hightower! It\\'s jist as I was a-sayin\\' to Brer Phelps, his own self. S\\'e, what do _you_ think of it, Sister Hotchkiss, s\\'e? Think o\\' what, Brer Phelps, s\\'I? Think o\\' that bed-leg sawed off that a way, s\\'e? _think_ of it, s\\'I? I lay it never sawed _itself_ off, s\\'I--somebody _sawed_ it, s\\'I; that\\'s my opinion, take it or leave it, it mayn\\'t be no \\'count, s\\'I, but sich as \\'t is, it\\'s my opinion, s\\'I, \\'n\\' if any body k\\'n start a better one, s\\'I, let him _do_ it, s\\'I, that\\'s all. I says to Sister Dunlap, s\\'I--\" \"Why, dog my cats, they must a ben a house-full o\\' niggers in there every night for four weeks to a done all that work, Sister Phelps. Look at that shirt--every last inch of it kivered over with secret African writ\\'n done with blood! Must a ben a raft uv \\'m at it right along, all the time, amost. Why, I\\'d give two dollars to have it read to me; \\'n\\' as for the niggers that wrote it, I \\'low I\\'d take \\'n\\' lash \\'m t\\'ll--\" \"People to _help_ him, Brother Marples! Well, I reckon you\\'d _think_ so if you\\'d a been in this house for a while back. Why, they\\'ve stole everything they could lay their hands on--and we a-watching all the time, mind you. They stole that shirt right off o\\' the line! and as for that sheet they made the rag ladder out of, ther\\' ain\\'t no telling how many times they _didn\\'t_ steal that; and flour, and candles, and candlesticks, and spoons, and the old warming-pan, and most a thousand things that I disremember now, and my new calico dress; and me and Silas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day _and_ night, as I was a-telling you, and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them; and here at the last minute, lo and behold you, they slides right in under our noses and fools us, and not only fools _us_ but the Injun Territory robbers too, and actuly gets _away_ with that nigger safe and sound, and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs right on their very heels at that very time! I tell you, it just bangs anything I ever _heard_ of. Why, _sperits_ couldn\\'t a done better and been no smarter. And I reckon they must a _been_ sperits--because, _you_ know our dogs, and ther\\' ain\\'t no better; well, them dogs never even got on the _track_ of \\'m once! You explain _that_ to me if you can!--_any_ of you!\" \"Well, it does beat--\" \"Laws alive, I never--\" \"So help me, I wouldn\\'t a be--\" \"_House_-thieves as well as--\" \"Goodnessgracioussakes, I\\'d a ben afeard to live in sich a--\" \"\\'Fraid to _live_!--why, I was that scared I dasn\\'t hardly go to bed, or get up, or lay down, or _set_ down, Sister Ridgeway. Why, they\\'d steal the very--why, goodness sakes, you can guess what kind of a fluster I was in by the time midnight come last night. I hope to gracious if I warn\\'t afraid they\\'d steal some o\\' the family! I was just to that pass I didn\\'t have no reasoning faculties no more. It looks foolish enough _now_, in the daytime; but I says to myself, there\\'s my two poor boys asleep, \\'way up stairs in that lonesome room, and I declare to goodness I was that uneasy \\'t I crep\\' up there and locked \\'em in! I _did_. And anybody would. Because, you know, when you get scared that way, and it keeps running on, and getting worse and worse all the time, and your wits gets to addling, and you get to doing all sorts o\\' wild things, and by and by you think to yourself, spos\\'n I was a boy, and was away up there, and the door ain\\'t locked, and you--\" She stopped, looking kind of wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and when her eye lit on me--I got up and took a walk. Says I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that room this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little. So I done it. But I dasn\\'t go fur, or she\\'d a sent for me. And when it was late in the day the people all went, and then I come in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me and \"Sid,\" and the door was locked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the lightning-rod, and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn\\'t never want to try _that_ no more. And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas before; and then she said she\\'d forgive us, and maybe it was all right enough anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, for all boys was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so, as long as no harm hadn\\'t come of it, she judged she better put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still, stead of fretting over what was past and done. So then she kissed me, and patted me on the head, and dropped into a kind of a brown study; and pretty soon jumps up, and says: \"Why, lawsamercy, it\\'s most night, and Sid not come yet! What _has_ become of that boy?\" I see my chance; so I skips up and says: \"I\\'ll run right up to town and get him,\" I says. \"No you won\\'t,\" she says. \"You\\'ll stay right wher\\' you are; _one\\'s_ enough to be lost at a time. If he ain\\'t here to supper, your uncle \\'ll go.\" Well, he warn\\'t there to supper; so right after supper uncle went. He come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn\\'t run across Tom\\'s track. Aunt Sally was a good _deal_ uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said there warn\\'t no occasion to be--boys will be boys, he said, and you\\'ll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right. So she had to be satisfied. But she said she\\'d set up for him a while anyway, and keep a light burning so he could see it. And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her candle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and like I couldn\\'t look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and talked with me a long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn\\'t seem to want to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me every now and then if I reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybe drownded, and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead, and she not by him to help him, and so the tears would drip down silent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right, and would be home in the morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me, and tell me to say it again, and keep on saying it, because it done her good, and she was in so much trouble. And when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle, and says: \"The door ain\\'t going to be locked, Tom, and there\\'s the window and the rod; but you\\'ll be good, _won\\'t_ you? And you won\\'t go? For _my_ sake.\" Laws knows I _wanted_ to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was all intending to go; but after that I wouldn\\'t a went, not for kingdoms. But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very restless. And twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped around front, and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her eyes towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could do something for her, but I couldn\\'t, only to swear that I wouldn\\'t never do nothing to grieve her any more. And the third time I waked up at dawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candle was most out, and her old gray head was resting on her hand, and she was asleep. ',\n",
              " 'XLII. THE old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn\\'t get no track of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not eating anything. And by and by the old man says: \"Did I give you the letter?\" \"What letter?\" \"The one I got yesterday out of the post-office.\" \"No, you didn\\'t give me no letter.\" \"Well, I must a forgot it.\" So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had laid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her. She says: \"Why, it\\'s from St. Petersburg--it\\'s from Sis.\" I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn\\'t stir. But before she could break it open she dropped it and run--for she see something. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old doctor; and Jim, in _her_ calico dress, with his hands tied behind him; and a lot of people. I hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy, and rushed. She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says: \"Oh, he\\'s dead, he\\'s dead, I know he\\'s dead!\" And Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other, which showed he warn\\'t in his right mind; then she flung up her hands, and says: \"He\\'s alive, thank God! And that\\'s enough!\" and she snatched a kiss of him, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders right and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tongue could go, every jump of the way. I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the old doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house. The men was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to all the other niggers around there, so they wouldn\\'t be trying to run away like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a whole family scared most to death for days and nights. But the others said, don\\'t do it, it wouldn\\'t answer at all; he ain\\'t our nigger, and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure. So that cooled them down a little, because the people that\\'s always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that hain\\'t done just right is always the very ones that ain\\'t the most anxious to pay for him when they\\'ve got their satisfaction out of him. They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side the head once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let on to know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes on him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to a big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and both legs, and said he warn\\'t to have nothing but bread and water to eat after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because he didn\\'t come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl good-bye cussing, and then the old doctor comes and takes a look, and says: \"Don\\'t be no rougher on him than you\\'re obleeged to, because he ain\\'t a bad nigger. When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn\\'t cut the bullet out without some help, and he warn\\'t in no condition for me to leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little worse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn\\'t let me come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he\\'d kill me, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn\\'t do anything at all with him; so I says, I got to have _help_ somehow; and the minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he\\'ll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well. Of course I judged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I _was_! and there I had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night. It was a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and of course I\\'d of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn\\'t, because the nigger might get away, and then I\\'d be to blame; and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail. So there I had to stick plumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it, and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he\\'d been worked main hard lately. I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars--and kind treatment, too. I had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at home--better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I _was_, with both of \\'m on my hands, and there I had to stick till about dawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start. He ain\\'t no bad nigger, gentlemen; that\\'s what I think about him.\" Somebody says: \"Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I\\'m obleeged to say.\" Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was according to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him. Then they all agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some notice took of it, and reward. So every one of them promised, right out and hearty, that they wouldn\\'t cuss him no more. Then they come out and locked him up. I hoped they was going to say he could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they didn\\'t think of it, and I reckoned it warn\\'t best for me to mix in, but I judged I\\'d get the doctor\\'s yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon as I\\'d got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me--explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger. But I had plenty time. Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day and all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged him. Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt Sally was gone to get a nap. So I slips to the sick-room, and if I found him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and pale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come. So I set down and laid for him to wake. In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in, and there I was, up a stump again! She motioned me to be still, and set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he\\'d been sleeping like that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the time, and ten to one he\\'d wake up in his right mind. So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says: \"Hello!--why, I\\'m at _home_! How\\'s that? Where\\'s the raft?\" \"It\\'s all right,\" I says. \"And _Jim_?\" \"The same,\" I says, but couldn\\'t say it pretty brash. But he never noticed, but says: \"Good! Splendid! _Now_ we\\'re all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?\" I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says: \"About what, Sid?\" \"Why, about the way the whole thing was done.\" \"What whole thing?\" \"Why, _the_ whole thing. There ain\\'t but one; how we set the runaway nigger free--me and Tom.\" \"Good land! Set the run--What _is_ the child talking about! Dear, dear, out of his head again!\" \"_No_, I ain\\'t out of my _head_; I know all what I\\'m talking about. We _did_ set him free--me and Tom. We laid out to do it, and we _done_ it. And we done it elegant, too.\" He\\'d got a start, and she never checked him up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and I see it warn\\'t no use for _me_ to put in. \"Why, Aunty, it cost us a power of work--weeks of it--hours and hours, every night, whilst you was all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt, and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things, and you can\\'t think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can\\'t think _half_ the fun it was. And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things, and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket--\" \"Mercy sakes!\" \"--and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company for Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let them go by, and when the dogs come they warn\\'t interested in us, but went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the raft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by ourselves, and _wasn\\'t_ it bully, Aunty!\" \"Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days! So it was _you_, you little rapscallions, that\\'s been making all this trouble, and turned everybody\\'s wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death. I\\'ve as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out o\\' you this very minute. To think, here I\\'ve been, night after night, a--_you_ just get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I\\'ll tan the Old Harry out o\\' both o\\' ye!\" But Tom, he _was_ so proud and joyful, he just _couldn\\'t_ hold in, and his tongue just _went_ it--she a-chipping in, and spitting fire all along, and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and she says: \"_Well_, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it _now_, for mind I tell you if I catch you meddling with him again--\" \"Meddling with _who_?\" Tom says, dropping his smile and looking surprised. \"With _who_? Why, the runaway nigger, of course. Who\\'d you reckon?\" Tom looks at me very grave, and says: \"Tom, didn\\'t you just tell me he was all right? Hasn\\'t he got away?\" \"_Him_?\" says Aunt Sally; \"the runaway nigger? \\'Deed he hasn\\'t. They\\'ve got him back, safe and sound, and he\\'s in that cabin again, on bread and water, and loaded down with chains, till he\\'s claimed or sold!\" Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening and shutting like gills, and sings out to me: \"They hain\\'t no _right_ to shut him up! SHOVE!--and don\\'t you lose a minute. Turn him loose! he ain\\'t no slave; he\\'s as free as any cretur that walks this earth!\" \"What _does_ the child mean?\" \"I mean every word I _say_, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don\\'t go, _I\\'ll_ go. I\\'ve knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there. Old Miss Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him down the river, and _said_ so; and she set him free in her will.\" \"Then what on earth did _you_ want to set him free for, seeing he was already free?\" \"Well, that _is_ a question, I must say; and just like women! Why, I wanted the _adventure_ of it; and I\\'d a waded neck-deep in blood to--goodness alive, _Aunt Polly!_\" If she warn\\'t standing right there, just inside the door, looking as sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never! Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and cried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed, for it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me. And I peeped out, and in a little while Tom\\'s Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles--kind of grinding him into the earth, you know. And then she says: \"Yes, you _better_ turn y\\'r head away--I would if I was you, Tom.\" \"Oh, deary me!\" says Aunt Sally; \"_Is_ he changed so? Why, that ain\\'t _Tom_, it\\'s Sid; Tom\\'s--Tom\\'s--why, where is Tom? He was here a minute ago.\" \"You mean where\\'s Huck _Finn_--that\\'s what you mean! I reckon I hain\\'t raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I _see_ him. That _would_ be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that bed, Huck Finn.\" So I done it. But not feeling brash. Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever see--except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told it all to him. It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn\\'t know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the oldest man in the world couldn\\'t a understood it. So Tom\\'s Aunt Polly, she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom Sawyer--she chipped in and says, \"Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I\\'m used to it now, and \\'tain\\'t no need to change\"--that when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it--there warn\\'t no other way, and I knowed he wouldn\\'t mind, because it would be nuts for him, being a mystery, and he\\'d make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly satisfied. And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made things as soft as he could for me. And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn\\'t ever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he _could_ help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up. Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and _Sid_ had come all right and safe, she says to herself: \"Look at that, now! I might have expected it, letting him go off that way without anybody to watch him. So now I got to go and trapse all the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that creetur\\'s up to _this_ time, as long as I couldn\\'t seem to get any answer out of you about it.\" \"Why, I never heard nothing from you,\" says Aunt Sally. \"Well, I wonder! Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean by Sid being here.\" \"Well, I never got \\'em, Sis.\" Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says: \"You, Tom!\" \"Well--_what_?\" he says, kind of pettish. \"Don\\'t you what _me_, you impudent thing--hand out them letters.\" \"What letters?\" \"_Them_ letters. I be bound, if I have to take a-holt of you I\\'ll--\" \"They\\'re in the trunk. There, now. And they\\'re just the same as they was when I got them out of the office. I hain\\'t looked into them, I hain\\'t touched them. But I knowed they\\'d make trouble, and I thought if you warn\\'t in no hurry, I\\'d--\" \"Well, you _do_ need skinning, there ain\\'t no mistake about it. And I wrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s\\'pose he--\" \"No, it come yesterday; I hain\\'t read it yet, but _it\\'s_ all right, I\\'ve got that one.\" I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn\\'t, but I reckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to. So I never said nothing. ',\n",
              " 'THE LAST THE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea, time of the evasion?--what it was he\\'d planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before? And he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we got Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft, and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him about his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style, and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all the niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would we. But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was. We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom, they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do. And we had him up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty dollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good, and Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says: \"Dah, now, Huck, what I tell you?--what I tell you up dah on Jackson islan\\'? I _tole_ you I got a hairy breas\\', en what\\'s de sign un it; en I _tole_ you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich _agin_; en it\\'s come true; en heah she is! _dah_, now! doan\\' talk to _me_--signs is _signs_, mine I tell you; en I knowed jis\\' \\'s well \\'at I \\'uz gwineter be rich agin as I\\'s a-stannin\\' heah dis minute!\" And then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le\\'s all three slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a couple of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I ain\\'t got no money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn\\'t get none from home, because it\\'s likely pap\\'s been back before now, and got it all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up. \"No, he hain\\'t,\" Tom says; \"it\\'s all there yet--six thousand dollars and more; and your pap hain\\'t ever been back since. Hadn\\'t when I come away, anyhow.\" Jim says, kind of solemn: \"He ain\\'t a-comin\\' back no mo\\', Huck.\" I says: \"Why, Jim?\" \"Nemmine why, Huck--but he ain\\'t comin\\' back no mo.\" But I kept at him; so at last he says: \"Doan\\' you \\'member de house dat was float\\'n down de river, en dey wuz a man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn\\' let you come in? Well, den, you kin git yo\\' money when you wants it, kase dat wuz him.\" Tom\\'s most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so there ain\\'t nothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I\\'d a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn\\'t a tackled it, and ain\\'t a-going to no more. But I reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she\\'s going to adopt me and sivilize me, and I can\\'t stand it. I been there before. THE END.

It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life. Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.

Inflection of the exterior tentacles owing to the glands of the disc being excited by repeated touches, or by objects left in contact with them—Difference in the action of bodies yielding and not yielding soluble nitrogenous matter—Inflection of the exterior tentacles directly caused by objects left in contact with their glands—Periods of commencing inflection and of subsequent re-expansion—Extreme minuteness of the particles causing inflection—Action under water—Inflection of the exterior tentacles when their glands are excited by repeated touches—Falling drops of water do not cause inflection.

Nature of the contents of the cells before aggregation—Various causes which excite aggregation—The process commences within the glands and travels down the tentacles— Description of the aggregated masses and of their spontaneous movements—Currents of protoplasm along the walls of the cells—Action of carbonate of ammonia—The granules in the protoplasm which flows along the walls coalesce with the central masses—Minuteness of the quantity of carbonate of ammonia causing aggregation—Action of other salts of ammonia—Of other substances, organic fluids, &c.—Of water—Of heat—Redissolution of the aggregated masses—Proximate causes of the aggregation of the protoplasm—Summary and concluding remarks—Supplementary observations on aggregation in the roots of plants. ',\n",

Nature of the experiments—Effects of boiling water—Warm water causes rapid inflection— Water at a higher temperature does not cause immediate inflection, but does not kill the leaves, as shown by their subsequent re-expansion and by the aggregation of the protoplasm— A still higher temperature kills the leaves and coagulates the albuminous contents of the glands.

During the summer of 1860, I was surprised by finding how large a number of insects were caught by the leaves of the common sun-dew (Drosera rotundifolia) on a heath in Sussex. I had heard that insects were thus caught, but knew nothing further on the subject.* I * As Dr. Nitschke has given (‘Bot. Zeitung,’ 1860, p. 229) the bibliography of Drosera, I need not here go into details. Most of the notices published before 1860 are brief and unimportant. The oldest paper seems to have been one of the most valuable, namely, by Dr. Roth, in 1782. There is also an interesting though short account of the habits of Drosera by Dr. Milde, in the ‘Bot. Zeitung,’ 1852, p. 540. In 1855, in the ‘Annales des Sc. nat. bot.’ tom. iii. pp. 297 and 304, MM. Groenland and Trcul each published papers, with figures, on the structure of the leaves; but M. Trcul went so far as to doubt whether they possessed any power of movement. Dr. Nitschke’s papers in the ‘Bot. Zeitung’ for 1860 and 1861 are by far the most important ones which have been published, both on the habits and structure of this plant; and I shall frequently have occasion to quote from them. His discussions on several points, for instance on the transmission of an excitement from one part of the leaf to another, are excellent. On December 11, 1862, Mr. J. Scott read a paper before the Botanical Society of Edinburgh, [[page 2]] which was published in the ‘Gardeners’ Chronicle,’ 1863, p. 30. Mr. Scott shows that gentle irritation of the hairs, as well as insects placed on the disc of the leaf, cause the hairs to bend inwards. Mr. A.W. Bennett also gave another interesting account of the movements of the leaves before the British Association for 1873. In this same year Dr. Warming published an essay, in which he describes the structure of the so-called hairs, entitled, “Sur la Diffrence entre les Trichomes,” &c., extracted from the proceedings of the Soc. d’Hist. Nat. de Copenhague. I shall also have occasion hereafter to refer to a paper by Mrs. Treat, of New Jersey, on some American species of Drosera. Dr. Burdon Sanderson delivered a lecture on Dionaea, before the Royal Institution published in ‘Nature,’ June 14, 1874, in which a short account of my observations on the power of true digestion possessed by Drosera and Dionaea first appeared. Prof. Asa Gray has done good service by calling attention to Drosera, and to other plants having similar habits, in ‘The Nation’ (1874, pp. 261 and 232), and in other publications. Dr. Hooker, also, in his important address on Carnivorous Plants (Brit. Assoc., Belfast, 1874), has given a history of the subject. [page 2] gathered by chance a dozen plants, bearing fifty-six fully expanded leaves, and on thirty-one of these dead insects or remnants of them adhered; and, no doubt, many more would have been caught afterwards by these same leaves, and still more by those as yet not expanded. On one plant all six leaves had caught their prey; and on several plants very many leaves had caught more than a single insect. On one large leaf I found the remains of thirteen distinct insects. Flies (Diptera) are captured much oftener than other insects. The largest kind which I have seen caught was a small butterfly (Caenonympha pamphilus); but the Rev. H.M. Wilkinson informs me that he found a large living dragon-fly with its body firmly held by two leaves. As this plant is extremely common in some districts, the number of insects thus annually slaughtered must be prodigious. Many plants cause the death of insects, for instance the sticky buds of the horse-chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum), without thereby receiving, as far as we can perceive, any advantage; but it was soon evident that Drosera was [page 3] excellently adapted for the special purpose of catching insects, so that the subject seemed well worthy of investigation. The results have proved highly remarkable; the more important ones being—firstly, the extraordinary FIG. 1.* (Drosera rotundifolia.) Leaf viewed from above; enlarged four times. sensitiveness of the glands to slight pressure and to minute doses of certain nitrogenous fluids, as shown by the movements of the so-called hairs or tentacles; * The drawings of Drosera and Dionaea, given in this work, were made for me by my son George Darwin; those of Aldrovanda, and of the several species of Utricularia, by my son Francis. They have been excellently reproduced on wood by Mr. Cooper, 188 Strand. [page 4] secondly, the power possessed by the leaves of rendering soluble or digesting nitrogenous substances, and of afterwards absorbing them; thirdly, the changes which take place within the cells of the tentacles, when the glands are excited in various ways. It is necessary, in the first place, to describe briefly the plant. It bears from two or three to five or six leaves, generally extended more or less horizontally, but sometimes standing vertically upwards. The shape and general appearance of a leaf is shown, as seen from above, in fig. 1, and as seen laterally, in fig. 2. The leaves are commonly a little broader than long, FIG. 2. (Drosera rotundifolia.) Old leaf viewed laterally; enlarged about five times. but this was not the case in the one here figured. The whole upper surface is covered with gland-bearing filaments, or tentacles, as I shall call them, from their manner of acting. The glands were counted on thirty-one leaves, but many of these were of unusually large size, and the average number was 192; the greatest number being 260, and the least 130. The glands are each surrounded by large drops of extremely viscid secretion, which, glittering in the sun, have given rise to the plant’s poetical name of the sun-dew. [The tentacles on the central part of the leaf or disc are short and stand upright, and their pedicels are green. Towards the margin they become longer and longer and more inclined [page 5] outwards, with their pedicels of a purple colour. Those on the extreme margin project in the same plane with the leaf, or more commonly (see fig. 2) are considerably reflexed. A few tentacles spring from the base of the footstalk or petiole, and these are the longest of all, being sometimes nearly 1/4 of an inch in length. On a leaf bearing altogether 252 tentacles, the short ones on the disc, having green pedicels, were in number to the longer submarginal and marginal tentacles, having purple pedicels, as nine to sixteen. A tentacle consists of a thin, straight, hair-like pedicel, carrying a gland on the summit. The pedicel is somewhat flattened, and is formed of several rows of elongated cells, filled with purple fluid or granular matter.* There is, however, a narrow zone close beneath the glands of the longer tentacles, and a broader zone near their bases, of a green tint. Spiral vessels, accompanied by simple vascular tissue, branch off from the vascular bundles in the blade of the leaf, and run up all the tentacles into the glands. Several eminent physiologists have discussed the homological nature of these appendages or tentacles, that is, whether they ought to be considered as hairs (trichomes) or prolongations of the leaf. Nitschke has shown that they include all the elements proper to the blade of a leaf; and the fact of their including vascular tissue was formerly thought to prove that they were prolongations of the leaf, but it is now known that vessels sometimes enter true hairs.** The power of movement which they possess is a strong argument against their being viewed as hairs. The conclusion which seems to me the most probable will be given in Chap. XV., namely that they existed primordially as glandular hairs, or mere epidermic formations, and that their upper part should still be so considered; but that their lower * According to Nitschke (‘Bot. Zeitung,’ 1861, p. 224) the purple fluid results from the metamorphosis of chlorophyll. Mr. Sorby examined the colouring matter with the spectroscope, and informs me that it consists of the commonest species of erythrophyll, “which is often met with in leaves with low vitality, and in parts, like the petioles, which carry on leaf-functions in a very imperfect manner. All that can be said, therefore, is that the hairs (or tentacles) are coloured like parts of a leaf which do not fulfil their proper office.” ** Dr. Nitschke has discussed this subject in ‘Bot. Zeitung,’ 1861, p. 241 &c. See also Dr. Warming (‘Sur la Diffrence entre les Trichomes’ &c., 1873), who gives references to various publications. See also Groenland and Trcul ‘Annal. des Sc. nat. bot.’ (4th series), tom. iii. 1855, pp. 297 and 303. [page 6] part, which alone is capable of movement, consists of a prolongation of the leaf; the spiral vessels being extended from this to the uppermost part. We shall hereafter see that the terminal tentacles of the divided leaves of Roridula are still in an intermediate condition. The glands, with the exception of those borne by the extreme FIG. 3. (Drosera rotundifolia.) Longitudinal section of a gland; greatly magnified. From Dr. Warming. marginal tentacles, are oval, and of nearly uniform size, viz. about 4/500 of an inch in length. Their structure is remarkable, and their functions complex, for they secrete, absorb, and are acted on by various stimulants. They consist of an outer layer of small polygonal cells, containing purple granular matter or fluid, and with the walls thicker than those of the pedicels. [page 7] Within this layer of cells there is an inner one of differently shaped ones, likewise filled with purple fluid, but of a slightly different tint, and differently affected by chloride of gold. These two layers are sometimes well seen when a gland has been crushed or boiled in caustic potash. According to Dr. Warming, there is still another layer of much more elongated cells, as shown in the accompanying section (fig. 3) copied from his work; but these cells were not seen by Nitschke, nor by me. In the centre there is a group of elongated, cylindrical cells of unequal lengths, bluntly pointed at their upper ends, truncated or rounded at their lower ends, closely pressed together, and remarkable from being surrounded by a spiral line, which can be separated as a distinct fibre. These latter cells are filled with limpid fluid, which after long immersion in alcohol deposits much brown matter. I presume that they are actually connected with the spiral vessels which run up the tentacles, for on several occasions the latter were seen to divide into two or three excessively thin branches, which could be traced close up to the spiriferous cells. Their development has been described by Dr. Warming. Cells of the same kind have been observed in other plants, as I hear from Dr. Hooker, and were seen by me in the margins of the leaves of Pinguicula. Whatever their function may be, they are not necessary for the secretion of a digestive fluid, or for absorption, or for the communication of a motor impulse to other parts of the leaf, as we may infer from the structure of the glands in some other genera of the Droseraceae. The extreme marginal tentacles differ slightly from the others. Their bases are broader, and besides their own vessels, they receive a fine branch from those which enter the tentacles on each side. Their glands are much elongated, and lie embedded on the upper surface of the pedicel, instead of standing at the apex. In other respects they do not differ essentially from the oval ones, and in one specimen I found every possible transition between the two states. In another specimen there were no long-headed glands. These marginal tentacles lose their irritability earlier than the others; and when a stimulus is applied to the centre of the leaf, they are excited into action after the others. When cut-off leaves are immersed in water, they alone often become inflected. The purple fluid or granular matter which fills the cells of the glands differs to a certain extent from that within the cells of the pedicels. For when a leaf is placed in hot water or in certain acids, the glands become quite white and opaque, whereas [page 8] the cells of the pedicels are rendered of a bright red, with the exception of those close beneath the glands. These latter cells lose their pale red tint; and the green matter which they, as well as the basal cells, contain, becomes of a brighter green. The petioles bear many multicellular hairs, some of which near the blade are surmounted, according to Nitschke, by a few rounded cells, which appear to be rudimentary glands. Both surfaces of the leaf, the pedicels of the tentacles, especially the lower sides of the outer ones, and the petioles, are studded with minute papillae (hairs or trichomes), having a conical basis, and bearing on their summits two, and occasionally three or even four, rounded cells, containing much protoplasm. These papillae are generally colourless, but sometimes include a little purple fluid. They vary in development, and graduate, as Nitschke* states, and as I repeatedly observed, into the long multicellular hairs. The latter, as well as the papillae, are probably rudiments of formerly existing tentacles. I may here add, in order not to recur to the papillae, that they do not secrete, but are easily permeated by various fluids: thus when living or dead leaves are immersed in a solution of one part of chloride of gold, or of nitrate of silver, to 437 of water, they are quickly blackened, and the discoloration soon spreads to the surrounding tissue. The long multicellular hairs are not so quickly affected. After a leaf had been left in a weak infusion of raw meat for 10 hours, the cells of the papillae had evidently absorbed animal matter, for instead of limpid fluid they now contained small aggregated masses of protoplasm, which slowly and incessantly changed their forms. A similar result followed from an immersion of only 15 minutes in a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 218 of water, and the adjoining cells of the tentacles, on which the papillae were seated, now likewise contained aggregated masses of protoplasm. We may therefore conclude that when a leaf has closely clasped a captured insect in the manner immediately to be described, the papillae, which project from the upper surface of the leaf and of the tentacles, probably absorb some of the animal matter dissolved in the secretion; but this cannot be the case with the papillae on the backs of the leaves or on the petioles.] * Nitschke has elaborately described and figured these papillae, ‘Bot. Zeitung,’ 1861, pp. 234, 253, 254. [page 9] _Preliminary Sketch of the Action of the several Parts, and of the Manner in which Insects are Captured._ If a small organic or inorganic object be placed on the glands in the centre of a leaf, these transmit a motor impulse to the marginal tentacles. The nearer ones are first affected and slowly bend towards the centre, and then those farther off, until at last all become closely inflected over the object. This takes place in from one hour to four or five or more hours. The difference in the time required depends on many circumstances; namely on the size of the object and on its nature, that is, whether it contains soluble matter of the proper kind; on the vigour and age of the leaf; whether it has lately been in action; and, according to Nitschke,* on the temperature of the day, as likewise seemed to me to be the case. A living insect is a more efficient object than a dead one, as in struggling it presses against the glands of many tentacles. An insect, such as a fly, with thin integuments, through which animal matter in solution can readily pass into the surrounding dense secretion, is more efficient in causing prolonged inflection than an insect with a thick coat, such as a beetle. The inflection of the tentacles takes place indifferently in the light and darkness; and the plant is not subject to any nocturnal movement of so-called sleep. If the glands on the disc are repeatedly touched or brushed, although no object is left on them, the marginal tentacles curve inwards. So again, if drops of various fluids, for instance of saliva or of a solution of any salt of ammonia, are placed on the central glands, the same result quickly follows, sometimes in under half an hour. * ‘Bot. Zeitung,’ 1860, p. 246. [page 10] The tentacles in the act of inflection sweep through a wide space; thus a marginal tentacle, extended in the same plane with the blade, moves through an angle of 180o; and I have seen the much reflected tentacles of a leaf which stood upright move through an angle of not less than 270o. The bending part is almost confined to a short space near the base; but a rather larger portion of the elongated exterior tentacles FIG. 4. (Drosera rotundifolia.) Leaf (enlarged) with all the tentacles closely inflected, from immersion in a solution of phosphate of ammonia (one part to 87,500 of water.) FIG. 5. (Drosera rotundifolia.) Leaf (enlarged) with the tentacles on one side inflected over a bit of meat placed on the disc. becomes slightly incurved; the distal half in all cases remaining straight. The short tentacles in the centre of the disc when directly excited, do not become inflected; but they are capable of inflection if excited by a motor impulse received from other glands at a distance. Thus, if a leaf is immersed in an infusion of raw meat, or in a weak solution of ammonia (if the [page 11] solution is at all strong, the leaf is paralysed), all the exterior tentacles bend inwards (see fig. 4), excepting those near the centre, which remain upright; but these bend towards any exciting object placed on one side of the disc, as shown in fig. 5. The glands in fig. 4 may be seen to form a dark ring round the centre; and this follows from the exterior tentacles increasing in length in due proportion, as they stand nearer to the circumference. The kind of inflection which the tentacles undergo is best shown when the gland of one of the long exterior FIG. 6. (Drosera rotundifolia.) Diagram showing one of the exterior tentacles closely inflected; the two adjoining ones in their ordinary position.) tentacles is in any way excited; for the surrounding ones remain unaffected. In the accompanying outline (fig. 6) we see one tentacle, on which a particle of meat had been placed, thus bent towards the centre of the leaf, with two others retaining their original position. A gland may be excited by being simply touched three or four times, or by prolonged contact with organic or inorganic objects, and various fluids. I have distinctly seen, through a lens, a tentacle beginning to bend in ten seconds, after an object had been [page 12] placed on its gland; and I have often seen strongly pronounced inflection in under one minute. It is surprising how minute a particle of any substance, such as a bit of thread or hair or splinter of glass, if placed in actual contact with the surface of a gland, suffices to cause the tentacle to bend. If the object, which has been carried by this movement to the centre, be not very small, or if it contains soluble nitrogenous matter, it acts on the central glands; and these transmit a motor impulse to the exterior tentacles, causing them to bend inwards. Not only the tentacles, but the blade of the leaf often, but by no means always, becomes much incurved, when any strongly exciting substance or fluid is placed on the disc. Drops of milk and of a solution of nitrate of ammonia or soda are particularly apt to produce this effect. The blade is thus converted into a little cup. The manner in which it bends varies greatly. Sometimes the apex alone, sometimes one side, and sometimes both sides, become incurved. For instance, I placed bits of hard-boiled egg on three leaves; one had the apex bent towards the base; the second had both distal margins much incurved, so that it became almost triangular in outline, and this perhaps is the commonest case; whilst the third blade was not at all affected, though the tentacles were as closely inflected as in the two previous cases. The whole blade also generally rises or bends upwards, and thus forms a smaller angle with the footstalk than it did before. This appears at first sight a distinct kind of movement, but it results from the incurvation of that part of the margin which is attached to the footstalk, causing the blade, as a whole, to curve or move upwards. The length of time during which the tentacles as [page 13] well as the blade remain inflected over an object placed on the disc, depends on various circumstances; namely on the vigour and age of the leaf, and, according to Dr. Nitschke, on the temperature, for during cold weather when the leaves are inactive, they re-expand at an earlier period than when the weather is warm. But the nature of the object is by far the most important circumstance; I have repeatedly found that the tentacles remain clasped for a much longer average time over objects which yield soluble nitrogenous matter than over those, whether organic or inorganic, which yield no such matter. After a period varying from one to seven days, the tentacles and blade re-expand, and are then ready to act again. I have seen the same leaf inflected three successive times over insects placed on the disc; and it would probably have acted a greater number of times. The secretion from the glands is extremely viscid, so that it can be drawn out into long threads. It appears colourless, but stains little balls of paper pale pink. An object of any kind placed on a gland always causes it, as I believe, to secrete more freely; but the mere presence of the object renders this difficult to ascertain. In some cases, however, the effect was strongly marked, as when particles of sugar were added; but the result in this case is probably due merely to exosmose. Particles of carbonate and phosphate of ammonia and of some other salts, for instance sulphate of zinc, likewise increase the secretion. Immersion in a solution of one part of chloride of gold, or of some other salts, to 437 of water, excites the glands to largely increased secretion; on the other hand, tartrate of antimony produces no such effect. Immersion in many acids (of the strength of one part to 437 of water) likewise causes a wonderful amount of [page 14] secretion, so that when the leaves are lifted out, long ropes of extremely viscid fluid hang from them. Some acids, on the other hand, do not act in this manner. Increased secretion is not necessarily dependent on the inflection of the tentacle, for particles of sugar and of sulphate of zinc cause no movement. It is a much more remarkable fact that when an object, such as a bit of meat or an insect, is placed on the disc of a leaf, as soon as the surrounding tentacles become considerably inflected, their glands pour forth an increased amount of secretion. I ascertained this by selecting leaves with equal-sized drops on the two sides, and by placing bits of meat on one side of the disc; and as soon as the tentacles on this side became much inflected, but before the glands touched the meat, the drops of secretion became larger. This was repeatedly observed, but a record was kept of only thirteen cases, in nine of which increased secretion was plainly observed; the four failures being due either to the leaves being rather torpid, or to the bits of meat being too small to cause much inflection. We must therefore conclude that the central glands, when strongly excited, transmit some influence to the glands of the circumferential tentacles, causing them to secrete more copiously. It is a still more important fact (as we shall see more fully when we treat of the digestive power of the secretion) that when the tentacles become inflected, owing to the central glands having been stimulated mechanically, or by contact with animal matter, the secretion not only increases in quantity, but changes its nature and becomes acid; and this occurs before the glands have touched the object on the centre of the leaf. This acid is of a different nature from that contained in the tissue of the leaves. As long as the [page 15] tentacles remain closely inflected, the glands continue to secrete, and the secretion is acid; so that, if neutralised by carbonate of soda, it again becomes acid after a few hours. I have observed the same leaf with the tentacles closely inflected over rather indigestible substances, such as chemically prepared casein, pouring forth acid secretion for eight successive days, and over bits of bone for ten successive days. The secretion seems to possess, like the gastric juice of the higher animals, some antiseptic power. During very warm weather I placed close together two equal-sized bits of raw meat, one on a leaf of the Drosera, and the other surrounded by wet moss. They were thus left for 48 hrs., and then examined. The bit on the moss swarmed with infusoria, and was so much decayed that the transverse striae on the muscular fibres could no longer be clearly distinguished; whilst the bit on the leaf, which was bathed by the secretion, was free from infusoria, and its striae were perfectly distinct in the central and undissolved portion. In like manner small cubes of albumen and cheese placed on wet moss became threaded with filaments of mould, and had their surfaces slightly discoloured and disintegrated; whilst those on the leaves of Drosera remained clean, the albumen being changed into transparent fluid. As soon as tentacles, which have remained closely inflected during several days over an object, begin to re-expand, their glands secrete less freely, or cease to secrete, and are left dry. In this state they are covered with a film of whitish, semi-fibrous matter, which was held in solution by the secretion. The drying of the glands during the act of re-expansion is of some little service to the plant; for I have often observed that objects adhering to the leaves [page 16] could then be blown away by a breath of air; the leaves being thus left unencumbered and free for future action. Nevertheless, it often happens that all the glands do not become completely dry; and in this case delicate objects, such as fragile insects, are sometimes torn by the re-expansion of the tentacles into fragments, which remain scattered all over the leaf. After the re-expansion is complete, the glands quickly begin to re-secrete, and as soon as full-sized drops are formed, the tentacles are ready to clasp a new object. When an insect alights on the central disc, it is instantly entangled by the viscid secretion, and the surrounding tentacles after a time begin to bend, and ultimately clasp it on all sides. Insects are generally killed, according to Dr. Nitschke, in about a quarter of an hour, owing to their tracheae being closed by the secretion. If an insect adheres to only a few of the glands of the exterior tentacles, these soon become inflected and carry their prey to the tentacles next succeeding them inwards; these then bend inwards, and so onwards; until the insect is ultimately carried by a curious sort of rolling movement to the centre of the leaf. Then, after an interval, the tentacles on all sides become inflected and bathe their prey with their secretion, in the same manner as if the insect had first alighted on the central disc. It is surprising how minute an insect suffices to cause this action: for instance, I have seen one of the smallest species of gnats (Culex), which had just settled with its excessively delicate feet on the glands of the outermost tentacles, and these were already beginning to curve inwards, though not a single gland had as yet touched the body of the insect. Had I not interfered, this minute gnat would [page 17] assuredly have been carried to the centre of the leaf and been securely clasped on all sides. We shall hereafter see what excessively small doses of certain organic fluids and saline solutions cause strongly marked inflection. Whether insects alight on the leaves by mere chance, as a resting place, or are attracted by the odour of the secretion, I know not. I suspect from the number of insects caught by the English species of Drosera, and from what I have observed with some exotic species kept in my greenhouse, that the odour is attractive. In this latter case the leaves may be compared with a baited trap; in the former case with a trap laid in a run frequented by game, but without any bait. That the glands possess the power of absorption, is shown by their almost instantaneously becoming dark-coloured when given a minute quantity of carbonate of ammonia; the change of colour being chiefly or exclusively due to the rapid aggregation of their contents. When certain other fluids are added, they become pale-coloured. Their power of absorption is, however, best shown by the widely different results which follow, from placing drops of various nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous fluids of the same density on the glands of the disc, or on a single marginal gland; and likewise by the very different lengths of time during which the tentacles remain inflected over objects, which yield or do not yield soluble nitrogenous matter. This same conclusion might indeed have been inferred from the structure and movements of the leaves, which are so admirably adapted for capturing insects. The absorption of animal matter from captured insects explains how Drosera can flourish in extremely poor peaty soil,—in some cases where nothing but [page 18] sphagnum moss grows, and mosses depend altogether on the atmosphere for their nourishment. Although the leaves at a hasty glance do not appear green, owing to the purple colour of the tentacles, yet the upper and lower surfaces of the blade, the pedicels of the central tentacles, and the petioles contain chlorophyll, so that, no doubt, the plant obtains and assimilates carbonic acid from the air. Nevertheless, considering the nature of the soil where it grows, the supply of nitrogen would be extremely limited, or quite deficient, unless the plant had the power of obtaining this important element from captured insects. We can thus understand how it is that the roots are so poorly developed. These usually consist of only two or three slightly divided branches, from half to one inch in length, furnished with absorbent hairs. It appears, therefore, that the roots serve only to imbibe water; though, no doubt, they would absorb nutritious matter if present in the soil; for as we shall hereafter see, they absorb a weak solution of carbonate of ammonia. A plant of Drosera, with the edges of its leaves curled inwards, so as to form a temporary stomach, with the glands of the closely inflected tentacles pouring forth their acid secretion, which dissolves animal matter, afterwards to be absorbed, may be said to feed like an animal. But, differently from an animal, it drinks by means of its roots; and it must drink largely, so as to retain many drops of viscid fluid round the glands, sometimes as many as 260, exposed during the whole day to a glaring sun.

              " 'II. THE MOVEMENTS OF THE TENTACLES FROM THE CONTACT OF SOLID BODIES. Inflection of the exterior tentacles owing to the glands of the disc being excited by repeated touches, or by objects left in contact with them—Difference in the action of bodies yielding and not yielding soluble nitrogenous matter—Inflection of the exterior tentacles directly caused by objects left in contact with their glands—Periods of commencing inflection and of subsequent re-expansion—Extreme minuteness of the particles causing inflection—Action under water—Inflection of the exterior tentacles when their glands are excited by repeated touches—Falling drops of water do not cause inflection. I will give in this and the following chapters some of the many experiments made, which best illustrate the manner and rate of movement of the tentacles, when excited in various ways. The glands alone in all ordinary cases are susceptible to excitement. When excited, they do not themselves move or change form, but transmit a motor impulse to the bending part of their own and adjoining tentacles, and are thus carried towards the centre of the leaf. Strictly speaking, the glands ought to be called irritable, as the term sensitive generally implies consciousness; but no one supposes that the Sensitive-plant is conscious, and as I have found the term convenient, I shall use it without scruple. I will commence with the movements of the exterior tentacles, when indirectly excited by stimulants applied to the glands of the short tentacles on the disc. The exterior tentacles may be said in this case to be indirectly excited, because their own glands are not directly acted on. The stimulus proceeding from the glands of the disc acts on the bending part of the [page 20] exterior tentacles, near their bases, and does not (as will hereafter be proved) first travel up the pedicels to the glands, to be then reflected back to the bending place. Nevertheless, some influence does travel up to the glands, causing them to secrete more copiously, and the secretion to become acid. This latter fact is, I believe, quite new in the physiology of plants; it has indeed only recently been established that in the animal kingdom an influence can be transmitted along the nerves to glands, modifying their power of secretion, independently of the state of the blood-vessels. The Inflection of the Exterior Tentacles from the Glands of the Disc being excited by Repeated Touches, or by Objects left in Contact with them. The central glands of a leaf were irritated with a small stiff camel-hair brush, and in 70 m. (minutes) several of the outer tentacles were inflected; in 5 hrs. (hours) all the sub-marginal tentacles were inflected; next morning after an interval of about 22 hrs. they were fully re-expanded. In all the following cases the period is reckoned from the time of first irritation. Another leaf treated in the same manner had a few tentacles inflected in 20 m.; in 4 hrs. all the submarginal and some of the extreme marginal tentacles, as well as the edge of the leaf itself, were inflected; in 17 hrs. they had recovered their proper, expanded position. I then put a dead fly in the centre of the last-mentioned leaf, and next morning it was closely clasped; five days afterwards the leaf re-expanded, and the tentacles, with their glands surrounded by secretion, were ready to act again. Particles of meat, dead flies, bits of paper, wood, dried moss, sponge, cinders, glass, &c., were repeatedly [page 21] placed on leaves, and these objects were well embraced in various periods from one hr. to as long as 24 hrs., and set free again, with the leaf fully re-expanded, in from one or two, to seven or even ten days, according to the nature of the object. On a leaf which had naturally caught two flies, and therefore had already closed and reopened either once or more probably twice, I put a fresh fly: in 7 hrs. it was moderately, and in 21 hrs. thoroughly well, clasped, with the edges of the leaf inflected. In two days and a half the leaf had nearly re-expanded; as the exciting object was an insect, this unusually short period of inflection was, no doubt, due to the leaf having recently been in action. Allowing this same leaf to rest for only a single day, I put on another fly, and it again closed, but now very slowly; nevertheless, in less than two days it succeeded in thoroughly clasping the fly. When a small object is placed on the glands of the disc, on one side of a leaf, as near as possible to its circumference, the tentacles on this side are first affected, those on the opposite side much later, or, as often occurred, not at all. This was repeatedly proved by trials with bits of meat; but I will here give only the case of a minute fly, naturally caught and still alive, which I found adhering by its delicate feet to the glands on the extreme left side of the central disc. The marginal tentacles on this side closed inwards and killed the fly, and after a time the edge of the leaf on this side also became inflected, and thus remained for several days, whilst neither the tentacles nor the edge on the opposite side were in the least affected. If young and active leaves are selected, inorganic particles not larger than the head of a small pin, placed on the central glands, sometimes cause the [page 22] outer tentacles to bend inwards. But this follows much more surely and quickly, if the object contains nitrogenous matter which can be dissolved by the secretion. On one occasion I observed the following unusual circumstance. Small bits of raw meat (which acts more energetically than any other substance), of paper, dried moss, and of the quill of a pen were placed on several leaves, and they were all embraced equally well in about 2 hrs. On other occasions the above-named substances, or more commonly particles of glass, coal-cinder (taken from the fire), stone, gold-leaf, dried grass, cork, blotting-paper, cotton-wool, and hair rolled up into little balls, were used, and these substances, though they were sometimes well embraced, often caused no movement whatever in the outer tentacles, or an extremely slight and slow movement. Yet these same leaves were proved to be in an active condition, as they were excited to move by substances yielding soluble nitrogenous matter, such as bits of raw or roast meat, the yolk or white of boiled eggs, fragments of insects of all orders, spiders, &c. I will give only two instances. Minute flies were placed on the discs of several leaves, and on others balls of paper, bits of moss and quill of about the same size as the flies, and the latter were well embraced in a few hours; whereas after 25 hrs. only a very few tentacles were inflected over the other objects. The bits of paper, moss, and quill were then removed from these leaves, and bits of raw meat placed on them; and now all the tentacles were soon energetically inflected. Again, particles of coal-cinder (weighing rather more than the flies used in the last experiment) were placed on the centres of three leaves: after an interval of 19 hrs. one of the particles was tolerably well embraced; [page 23] a second by a very few tentacles; and a third by none. I then removed the particles from the two latter leaves, and put on them recently killed flies. These were fairly well embraced in 7 1/2 hrs. and thoroughly after 20 1/2 hrs.; the tentacles remaining inflected for many subsequent days. On the other hand, the one leaf which had in the course of 19 hrs. embraced the bit of cinder moderately well, and to which no fly was given, after an additional 33 hrs. (i.e. in 52 hrs. from the time when the cinder was put on) was completely re-expanded and ready to act again. From these and numerous other experiments not worth giving, it is certain that inorganic substances, or such organic substances as are not attacked by the secretion, act much less quickly and efficiently than organic substances yielding soluble matter which is absorbed. Moreover, I have met with very few exceptions to the rule, and these exceptions apparently depended on the leaf having been too recently in action, that the tentacles remain clasped for a much longer time over organic bodies of the nature just specified than over those which are not acted on by the secretion, or over inorganic objects.* * Owing to the extraordinary belief held by M. Ziegler (‘Comptes rendus,’ May 1872, p. 122), that albuminous substances, if held for a moment between the fingers, acquire the property of making the tentacles of Drosera contract, whereas, if not thus held, they have no such power, I tried some experiments with great care, but the results did not confirm this belief. Red-hot cinders were taken out of the fire, and bits of glass, cotton-thread, blotting paper and thin slices of cork were immersed in boiling water; and particles were then placed (every instrument with which they were touched having been previously immersed in boiling water) on the glands of several leaves, and they acted in exactly the same manner as other particles, which had been purposely handled for some time. Bits of a boiled egg, cut with a knife which had been washed in boiling water, also acted like any other animal substance. I breathed on some leaves for above a minute, and repeated the act two or three times, with my mouth close to [[page 24]] them, but this produced no effect. I may here add, as showing that the leaves are not acted on by the odour of nitrogenous substances, that pieces of raw meat stuck on needles were fixed as close as possible, without actual contact, to several leaves, but produced no effect whatever. On the other hand, as we shall hereafter see, the vapours of certain volatile substances and fluids, such as of carbonate of ammonia, chloroform, certain essential oils, &c., cause inflection. M. Ziegler makes still more extraordinary statements with respect to the power of animal substances, which have been left close to, but not in contact with, sulphate of quinine. The action of salts of quinine will be described in a future chapter. Since the appearance of the paper above referred to, M. Ziegler has published a book on the same subject, entitled ‘Atonicit et Zoicit,’ 1874.) [page 24] The Inflection of the Exterior Tentacles as directly caused by Objects left in Contact with their Glands. I made a vast number of trials by placing, by means of a fine needle moistened with distilled water, and with the aid of a lens, particles of various substances on the viscid secretion surrounding the glands of the outer tentacles. I experimented on both the oval and long-headed glands. When a particle is thus placed on a single gland, the movement of the tentacle is particularly well seen in contrast with the stationary condition of the surrounding tentacles. (See previous fig. 6.) In four cases small particles of raw meat caused the tentacles to be greatly inflected in between 5 and 6 m. Another tentacle similarly treated, and observed with special care, distinctly, though slightly, changed its position in 10 s. (seconds); and this is the quickest movement seen by me. In 2 m. 30 s. it had moved through an angle of about 45o. The movement as seen through a lens resembled that of the hand of a large clock. In 5 m. it had moved through 90o, and when I looked again after 10 m., the particle had reached the centre of the leaf; so that the whole movement was completed in less [page 25] than 17 m. 30 s. In the course of some hours this minute bit of meat, from having been brought into contact with some of the glands of the central disc, acted centrifugally on the outer tentacles, which all became closely inflected. Fragments of flies were placed on the glands of four of the outer tentacles, extended in the same plane with that of the blade, and three of these fragments were carried in 35 m. through an angle of 180o to the centre. The fragment on the fourth tentacle was very minute, and it was not carried to the centre until 3 hrs. had elapsed. In three other cases minute flies or portions of larger ones were carried to the centre in 1 hr. 30 s. In these seven cases, the fragments or small flies, which had been carried by a single tentacle to the central glands, were well embraced by the other tentacles after an interval of from 4 to 10 hrs. I also placed in the manner just described six small balls of writing-paper (rolled up by the aid of pincers, so that they were not touched by my fingers) on the glands of six exterior tentacles on distinct leaves; three of these were carried to the centre in about 1 hr., and the other three in rather more than 4 hrs.; but after 24 hrs. only two of the six balls were well embraced by the other tentacles. It is possible that the secretion may have dissolved a trace of glue or animalised matter from the balls of paper. Four particles of coal-cinder were then placed on the glands of four exterior tentacles; one of these reached the centre in 3 hrs. 40 m.; the second in 9 hrs.; the third within 24 hrs., but had moved only part of the way in 9 hrs.; whilst the fourth moved only a very short distance in 24 hrs., and never moved any farther. Of the above three bits of cinder which were ultimately carried to the centre, one alone was well embraced by [page 26] many of the other tentacles. We here see clearly that such bodies as particles of cinder or little balls of paper, after being carried by the tentacles to the central glands, act very differently from fragments of flies, in causing the movement of the surrounding tentacles. I made, without carefully recording the times of movement, many similar trials with other substances, such as splinters of white and blue glass, particles of cork, minute bits of gold-leaf, &c.; and the proportional number of cases varied much in which the tentacles reached the centre, or moved only slightly, or not at all. One evening, particles of glass and cork, rather larger than those usually employed, were placed on about a dozen glands, and next morning, after 13 hrs., every single tentacle had carried its little load to the centre; but the unusually large size of the particles will account for this result. In another case 6/7 of the particles of cinder, glass, and thread, placed on separate glands, were carried towards, or actually to, the centre; in another case 7/9, in another 7/12, and in the last case only 7/26 were thus carried inwards, the small proportion being here due, at least in part, to the leaves being rather old and inactive. Occasionally a gland, with its light load, could be seen through a strong lens to move an extremely short distance and then stop; this was especially apt to occur when excessively minute particles, much less than those of which the measurements will be immediately given, were placed on glands; so that we here have nearly the limit of any action. I was so much surprised at the smallness of the particles which caused the tentacles to become greatly inflected that it seemed worth while carefully to ascertain how minute a particle would plainly act. [page 27] Accordingly measured lengths of a narrow strip of blotting paper, of fine cotton-thread, and of a woman’s hair, were carefully weighed for me by Mr. Trenham Reeks, in an excellent balance, in the laboratory in Jermyn Street. Short bits of the paper, thread, and hair were then cut off and measured by a micrometer, so that their weights could be easily calculated. The bits were placed on the viscid secretion surrounding the glands of the exterior tentacles, with the precautions already stated, and I am certain that the gland itself was never touched; nor indeed would a single touch have produced any effect. A bit of the blotting-paper, weighing 1/465 of a grain, was placed so as to rest on three glands together, and all three tentacles slowly curved inwards; each gland, therefore, supposing the weight to be distributed equally, could have been pressed on by only 1/1395 of a grain, or .0464 of a milligramme. Five nearly equal bits of cotton-thread were tried, and all acted. The shortest of these was 1/50 of an inch in length, and weighed 1/8197 of a grain. The tentacle in this case was considerably inflected in 1 hr. 30 m., and the bit of thread was carried to the centre of the leaf in 1 hr. 40 m. Again, two particles of the thinner end of a woman’s hair, one of these being 18/1000 of an inch in length, and weighing 1/35714 of a grain, the other 19/1000 of an inch in length, and weighing of course a little more, were placed on two glands on opposite sides of the same leaf, and these two tentacles were inflected halfway towards the centre in 1 hr. 10 m.; all the many other tentacles round the same leaf remaining motionless. The appearance of this one leaf showed in an unequivocal manner that these minute particles sufficed to cause the tentacles to bend. Altogether, ten such particles of hair were placed on ten glands on several leaves, and seven of them caused [page 28] the tentacles to move in a conspicuous manner. The smallest particle which was tried, and which acted plainly, was only 8/1000 of an inch (.203 millimetre) in length, and weighed the 1/78740 of a grain, or .000822 milligramme. In these several cases, not only was the inflection of the tentacles conspicuous, but the purple fluid within their cells became aggregated into little masses of protoplasm, in the manner to be described in the next chapter; and the aggregation was so plain that I could, by this clue alone, have readily picked out under the microscope all the tentacles which had carried their light loads towards the centre, from the hundreds of other tentacles on the same leaves which had not thus acted. My surprise was greatly excited, not only by the minuteness of the particles which caused movement, but how they could possibly act on the glands; for it must be remembered that they were laid with the greatest care on the convex surface of the secretion. At first I thought—but, as I now know, erroneously—that particles of such low specific gravity as those of cork, thread, and paper, would never come into contact with the surfaces of the glands. The particles cannot act simply by their weight being added to that of the secretion, for small drops of water, many times heavier than the particles, were repeatedly added, and never produced any effect. Nor does the disturbance of the secretion produce any effect, for long threads were drawn out by a needle, and affixed to some adjoining object, and thus left for hours; but the tentacles remained motionless. I also carefully removed the secretion from four glands with a sharply pointed piece of blotting-paper, so that they were exposed for a time naked to the air, but this caused no movement; yet these glands were [page 29] in an efficient state, for after 24 hrs. had elapsed, they were tried with bits of meat, and all became quickly inflected. It then occurred to me that particles floating on the secretion would cast shadows on the glands, which might be sensitive to the interception of the light. Although this seemed highly improbable, as minute and thin splinters of colourless glass acted powerfully, nevertheless, after it was dark, I put on, by the aid of a single tallow candle, as quickly as possible, particles of cork and glass on the glands of a dozen tentacles, as well as some of meat on other glands, and covered them up so that not a ray of light could enter; but by the next morning, after an interval of 13 hrs., all the particles were carried to the centres of the leaves. These negative results led me to try many more experiments, by placing particles on the surface of the drops of secretion, observing, as carefully as I could, whether they penetrated it and touched the surface of the glands. The secretion, from its weight, generally forms a thicker layer on the under than on the upper sides of the glands, whatever may be the position of the tentacles. Minute bits of dry cork, thread, blotting paper, and coal cinders were tried, such as those previously employed; and I now observed that they absorbed much more of the secretion, in the course of a few minutes, than I should have thought possible; and as they had been laid on the upper surface of the secretion, where it is thinnest, they were often drawn down, after a time, into contact with at least some one point of the gland. With respect to the minute splinters of glass and particles of hair, I observed that the secretion slowly spread itself a little over their surfaces, by which means they were likewise drawn downwards or sideways, and thus one end, or some minute [page 30] prominence, often came to touch, sooner or later, the gland. In the foregoing and following cases, it is probable that the vibrations, to which the furniture in every room is continually liable, aids in bringing the particles into contact with the glands. But as it was sometimes difficult, owing to the refraction of the secretion, to feel sure whether the particles were in contact, I tried the following experiment. Unusually minute particles of glass, hair, and cork, were gently placed on the drops round several glands, and very few of the tentacles moved. Those which were not affected were left for about half an hour, and the particles were then disturbed or tilted up several times with a fine needle under the microscope, the glands not being touched. And now in the course of a few minutes almost all the hitherto motionless tentacles began to move; and this, no doubt, was caused by one end or some prominence of the particles having come into contact with the surface of the glands. But as the particles were unusually minute, the movement was small. Lastly, some dark blue glass pounded into fine splinters was used, in order that the points of the particles might be better distinguished when immersed in the secretion; and thirteen such particles were placed in contact with the depending and therefore thicker part of the drops round so many glands. Five of the tentacles began moving after an interval of a few minutes, and in these cases I clearly saw that the particles touched the lower surface of the gland. A sixth tentacle moved after 1 hr. 45 m., and the particle was now in contact with the gland, which was not the case at first. So it was with the seventh tentacle, but its movement did not begin until 3 hrs. 45 m. had [page 31] elapsed. The remaining six tentacles never moved as long as they were observed; and the particles apparently never came into contact with the surfaces of the glands. From these experiments we learn that particles not containing soluble matter, when placed on glands, often cause the tentacles to begin bending in the course of from one to five minutes; and that in such cases the particles have been from the first in contact with the surfaces of the glands. When the tentacles do not begin moving for a much longer time, namely, from half an hour to three or four hours, the particles have been slowly brought into contact with the glands, either by the secretion being absorbed by the particles or by its gradual spreading over them, together with its consequent quicker evaporation. When the tentacles do not move at all, the particles have never come into contact with the glands, or in some cases the tentacles may not have been in an active condition. In order to excite movement, it is indispensable that the particles should actually rest on the glands; for a touch once, twice, or even thrice repeated by any hard body is not sufficient to excite movement. Another experiment, showing that extremely minute particles act on the glands when immersed in water, may here be given. A grain of sulphate of quinine was added to an ounce of water, which was not afterwards filtered; and on placing three leaves in ninety minims of this fluid, I was much surprised to find that all three leaves were greatly inflected in 15 m.; for I knew from previous trials that the solution does not act so quickly as this. It immediately occurred to me that the particles of the undissolved salt, which were so light as to float about, might have come [page 32] into contact with the glands, and caused this rapid movement. Accordingly I added to some distilled water a pinch of a quite innocent substance, namely, precipitated carbonate of lime, which consists of an impalpable powder; I shook the mixture, and thus got a fluid like thin milk. Two leaves were immersed in it, and in 6 m. almost every tentacle was much inflected. I placed one of these leaves under the microscope, and saw innumerable atoms of lime adhering to the external surface of the secretion. Some, however, had penetrated it, and were lying on the surfaces of the glands; and no doubt it was these particles which caused the tentacles to bend. When a leaf is immersed in water, the secretion instantly swells much; and I presume that it is ruptured here and there, so that little eddies of water rush in. If so, we can understand how the atoms of chalk, which rested on the surfaces of the glands, had penetrated the secretion. Anyone who has rubbed precipitated chalk between his fingers will have perceived how excessively fine the powder is. No doubt there must be a limit, beyond which a particle would be too small to act on a gland; but what this limit is, I know not. I have often seen fibres and dust, which had fallen from the air, on the glands of plants kept in my room, and these never induced any movement; but then such particles lay on the surface of the secretion and never reached the gland itself. Finally, it is an extraordinary fact that a little bit of soft thread, 1/50 of an inch in length and weighing 1/8197 of a grain, or of a human hair, 8/1000 of an inch in length and weighing only 1/78740 of a grain (.000822 milligramme), or particles of precipitated chalk, after resting for a short time on a gland, should induce some change in its cells, exciting them [page 33] to transmit a motor impulse throughout the whole length of the pedicel, consisting of about twenty cells, to near its base, causing this part to bend, and the tentacle to sweep through an angle of above 180o. That the contents of the cells of the glands, and afterwards those of the pedicels, are affected in a plainly visible manner by the pressure of minute particles, we shall have abundant evidence when we treat of the aggregation of protoplasm. But the case is much more remarkable than as yet stated; for the particles are supported by the viscid and dense secretion; nevertheless, even smaller ones than those of which the measurements have been given, when brought by an insensibly slow movement, through the means above specified, into contact with the surface of a gland, act on it, and the tentacle bends. The pressure exerted by the particle of hair, weighing only 1/78740 of a grain and supported by a dense fluid, must have been inconceivably slight. We may conjecture that it could hardly have equalled the millionth of a grain; and we shall hereafter see that far less than the millionth of a grain of phosphate of ammonia in solution, when absorbed by a gland, acts on it and induces movement. A bit of hair, 1/50 of an inch in length, and therefore much larger than those used in the above experiments, was not perceived when placed on my tongue; and it is extremely doubtful whether any nerve in the human body, even if in an inflamed condition, would be in any way affected by such a particle supported in a dense fluid, and slowly brought into contact with the nerve. Yet the cells of the glands of Drosera are thus excited to transmit a motor impulse to a distant point, inducing movement. It appears to me that hardly any more remarkable fact than this has been observed in the vegetable kingdom. [page 34] The Inflection of the Exterior Tentacles, when their Glands are excited by Repeated Touches. We have already seen that, if the central glands are excited by being gently brushed, they transmit a motor impulse to the exterior tentacles, causing them to bend; and we have now to consider the effects which follow from the glands of the exterior tentacles being themselves touched. On several occasions, a large number of glands were touched only once with a needle or fine brush, hard enough to bend the whole flexible tentacle; and though this must have caused a thousand-fold greater pressure than the weight of the above described particles, not a tentacle moved. On another occasion forty-five glands on eleven leaves were touched once, twice, or even thrice, with a needle or stiff bristle. This was done as quickly as possible, but with force sufficient to bend the tentacles; yet only six of them became inflected,—three plainly, and three in a slight degree. In order to ascertain whether these tentacles which were not affected were in an efficient state, bits of meat were placed on ten of them, and they all soon became greatly incurved. On the other hand, when a large number of glands were struck four, five, or six times with the same force as before, a needle or sharp splinter of glass being used, a much larger proportion of tentacles became inflected; but the result was so uncertain as to seem capricious. For instance, I struck in the above manner three glands, which happened to be extremely sensitive, and all three were inflected almost as quickly, as if bits of meat had been placed on them. On another occasion I gave a single for- [page 35] cible touch to a considerable number of glands, and not one moved; but these same glands, after an interval of some hours, being touched four or five times with a needle, several of the tentacles soon became inflected. The fact of a single touch or even of two or three touches not causing inflection must be of some service to the plant; as during stormy weather, the glands cannot fail to be occasionally touched by the tall blades of grass, or by other plants growing near; and it would be a great evil if the tentacles were thus brought into action, for the act of re-expansion takes a considerable time, and until the tentacles are re-expanded they cannot catch prey. On the other hand, extreme sensitiveness to slight pressure is of the highest service to the plant; for, as we have seen, if the delicate feet of a minute struggling insect press ever so lightly on the surfaces of two or three glands, the tentacles bearing these glands soon curl inwards and carry the insect with them to the centre, causing, after a time, all the circumferential tentacles to embrace it. Nevertheless, the movements of the plant are not perfectly adapted to its requirements; for if a bit of dry moss, peat, or other rubbish, is blown on to the disc, as often happens, the tentacles clasp it in a useless manner. They soon, however, discover their mistake and release such innutritious objects. It is also a remarkable fact, that drops of water falling from a height, whether under the form of natural or artificial rain, do not cause the tentacles to move; yet the drops must strike the glands with considerable force, more especially after the secretion has been all washed away by heavy rain; and this often occurs, [page 36] though the secretion is so viscid that it can be removed with difficulty merely by waving the leaves in water. If the falling drops of water are small, they adhere to the secretion, the weight of which must be increased in a much greater degree, as before remarked, than by the addition of minute particles of solid matter; yet the drops never cause the tentacles to become inflected. It would obviously have been a great evil to the plant (as in the case of occasional touches) if the tentacles were excited to bend by every shower of rain; but this evil has been avoided by the glands either having become through habit insensible to the blows and prolonged pressure of drops of water, or to their having been originally rendered sensitive solely to the contact of solid bodies. We shall hereafter see that the filaments on the leaves of Dionaea are likewise insensible to the impact of fluids, though exquisitely sensitive to momentary touches from any solid body. When the pedicel of a tentacle is cut off by a sharp pair of scissors quite close beneath the gland, the tentacle generally becomes inflected. I tried this experiment repeatedly, as I was much surprised at the fact, for all other parts of the pedicels are insensible to any stimulus. These headless tentacles after a time re-expand; but I shall return to this subject. On the other hand, I occasionally succeeded in crushing a gland between a pair of pincers, but this caused no inflection. In this latter case the tentacles seem paralysed, as likewise follows from the action of too strong solutions of certain salts, and by too great heat, whilst weaker solutions of the same salts and a more gentle heat cause movement. We shall also see in future chapters that various other fluids, some [page 37] vapours, and oxygen (after the plant has been for some time excluded from its action), all induce inflection, and this likewise results from an induced galvanic current.* * My son Francis, guided by the observations of Dr. Burdon Sanderson on Dionaea, finds that if two needles are inserted into the blade of a leaf of Drosera, the tentacles do not move; but that if similar needles in connection with the secondary coil of a Du Bois inductive apparatus are inserted, the tentacles curve inwards in the course of a few minutes. My son hopes soon to publish an account of his observations. [page 38] ',\n",

Nature of the contents of the cells before aggregation—Various causes which excite aggregation—The process commences within the glands and travels down the tentacles— Description of the aggregated masses and of their spontaneous movements—Currents of protoplasm along the walls of the cells—Action of carbonate of ammonia—The granules in the protoplasm which flows along the walls coalesce with the central masses—Minuteness of the quantity of carbonate of ammonia causing aggregation—Action of other salts of ammonia—Of other substances, organic fluids, &c.—Of water—Of heat—Redissolution of the aggregated masses—Proximate causes of the aggregation of the protoplasm—Summary and concluding remarks—Supplementary observations on aggregation in the roots of plants. I will here interrupt my account of the movements of the leaves, and describe the phenomenon of aggregation, to which subject I have already alluded. If the tentacles of a young, yet fully matured leaf, that has never been excited or become inflected, be examined, the cells forming the pedicels are seen to be filled with homogeneous, purple fluid. The walls are lined by a layer of colourless, circulating protoplasm; but this can be seen with much greater distinctness after the process of aggregation has been partly effected than before. The purple fluid which exudes from a crushed tentacle is somewhat coherent, and does not mingle with the surrounding water; it contains much flocculent or granular matter. But this matter may have been generated by the cells having been crushed; some degree of aggregation having been thus almost instantly caused. [page 39] If a tentacle is examined some hours after the gland has been excited by repeated touches, or by an inorganic or organic particle placed on it, or by the absorption of certain fluids, it presents a wholly changed appearance. The cells, instead of being filled with homogeneous purple fluid, now contain variously shaped masses of purple matter, suspended in a colourless or almost colourless fluid. The change is so conspicuous that it is visible through a weak lens, and even sometimes by the naked eye; the tentacles now have a mottled appearance, so that one thus affected can be picked out with ease from all the others. The same result follows if the glands on the disc are irritated in any manner, so that the exterior tentacles become inflected; for their contents will then be found in an aggregated condition, although their glands have not as yet touched any object. But aggregation may occur independently of inflection, as we shall presently see. By whatever cause the process may have been excited, it commences within the glands, and then travels down the tentacles. It can be observed much more distinctly in the upper cells of the pedicels than within the glands, as these are somewhat opaque. Shortly after the tentacles have re-expanded, the little masses of protoplasm are all redissolved, and the purple fluid within the cells becomes as homogeneous and transparent as it was at first. The process of redissolution travels upwards from the bases of the tentacles to the glands, and therefore in a reversed direction to that of aggregation. Tentacles in an aggregated condition were shown to Prof. Huxley, Dr. Hooker, and Dr. Burdon Sanderson, who observed the changes under the microscope, and were much struck with the whole phenomenon. [page 40] The little masses of aggregated matter are of the most diversified shapes, often spherical or oval, sometimes much elongated, or quite irregular with thread- or necklace-like or club-formed projections. They consist of thick, apparently viscid matter, which in the exterior tentacles is of a purplish, and in the short distal tentacles of a greenish, colour. These little masses incessantly change their forms and positions, being never at rest. A single mass will often separate into two, which afterwards reunite. Their movements are rather slow, and resemble those of Amoebae or of the white corpuscles of the blood. We FIG. 7. (Drosera rotundifolia.) Diagram of the same cell of a tentacle, showing the various forms successively assumed by the aggregated masses of protoplasm. may, therefore, conclude that they consist of protoplasm. If their shapes are sketched at intervals of a few minutes, they are invariably seen to have undergone great changes of form; and the same cell has been observed for several hours. Eight rude, though accurate sketches of the same cell, made at intervals of between 2 m. or 3 m., are here given (fig. 7), and illustrate some of the simpler and commonest changes. The cell A, when first sketched, included two oval masses of purple protoplasm touching each other. These became separate, as shown at B, and then reunited, as at C. After the next interval a very common appearance was presented— [page 41] D, namely, the formation of an extremely minute sphere at one end of an elongated mass. This rapidly increased in size, as shown in E, and was then re-absorbed, as at F, by which time another sphere had been formed at the opposite end. The cell above figured was from a tentacle of a dark red leaf, which had caught a small moth, and was examined under water. As I at first thought that the movements of the masses might be due to the absorption of water, I placed a fly on a leaf, and when after 18 hrs. all the tentacles were well inflected, these were examined without being immersed in water. The cell FIG. 8. (Drosera rotundifolia.) Diagram of the same cell of a tentacle, showing the various forms successively assumed by the aggregated masses of protoplasm. here represented (fig. 8) was from this leaf, being sketched eight times in the course of 15 m. These sketches exhibit some of the more remarkable changes which the protoplasm undergoes. At first, there was at the base of the cell 1, a little mass on a short footstalk, and a larger mass near the upper end, and these seemed quite separate. Nevertheless, they may have been connected by a fine and invisible thread of protoplasm, for on two other occasions, whilst one mass was rapidly increasing, and another in the same cell rapidly decreasing, I was able by varying the light and using a high power, to detect a connecting thread of extreme tenuity, which evidently served as [page 42] the channel of communication between the two. On the other hand, such connecting threads are sometimes seen to break, and their extremities then quickly become club-headed. The other sketches in fig. 8 show the forms successively assumed. Shortly after the purple fluid within the cells has become aggregated, the little masses float about in a colourless or almost colourless fluid; and the layer of white granular protoplasm which flows along the walls can now be seen much more distinctly. The stream flows at an irregular rate, up one wall and down the opposite one, generally at a slower rate across the narrow ends of the elongated cells, and so round and round. But the current sometimes ceases. The movement is often in waves, and their crests sometimes stretch almost across the whole width of the cell, and then sink down again. Small spheres of protoplasm, apparently quite free, are often driven by the current round the cells; and filaments attached to the central masses are swayed to and fro, as if struggling to escape. Altogether, one of these cells with the ever changing central masses, and with the layer of protoplasm flowing round the walls, presents a wonderful scene of vital activity. [Many observations were made on the contents of the cells whilst undergoing the process of aggregation, but I shall detail only a few cases under different heads. A small portion of a leaf was cut off, placed under a high power, and the glands very gently pressed under a compressor. In 15 m. I distinctly saw extremely minute spheres of protoplasm aggregating themselves in the purple fluid; these rapidly increased in size, both within the cells of the glands and of the upper ends of the pedicels. Particles of glass, cork, and cinders were also placed on the glands of many tentacles; in 1 hr. several of them were inflected, but after 1 hr. 35 m. there was no aggregation. Other tentacles with these particles were examined after 8 hrs., and [page 43] now all their cells had undergone aggregation; so had the cells of the exterior tentacles which had become inflected through the irritation transmitted from the glands of the disc, on which the transported particles rested. This was likewise the case with the short tentacles round the margins of the disc, which had not as yet become inflected. This latter fact shows that the process of aggregation is independent of the inflection of the tentacles, of which indeed we have other and abundant evidence. Again, the exterior tentacles on three leaves were carefully examined, and found to contain only homogeneous purple fluid; little bits of thread were then placed on the glands of three of them, and after 22 hrs. the purple fluid in their cells almost down to their bases was aggregated into innumerable, spherical, elongated, or filamentous masses of protoplasm. The bits of thread had been carried some time previously to the central disc, and this had caused all the other tentacles to become somewhat inflected; and their cells had likewise undergone aggregation, which however, it should be observed, had not as yet extended down to their bases, but was confined to the cells close beneath the glands. Not only do repeated touches on the glands* and the contact of minute particles cause aggregation, but if glands, without being themselves injured, are cut off from the summits of the pedicels, this induces a moderate amount of aggregation in the headless tentacles, after they have become inflected. On the other hand, if glands are suddenly crushed between pincers, as was tried in six cases, the tentacles seem paralysed by so great a shock, for they neither become inflected nor exhibit any signs of aggregation. Carbonate of Ammonia.—Of all the causes inducing aggregation, that which, as far as I have seen, acts the quickest, and is the most powerful, is a solution of carbonate of ammonia. Whatever its strength may be, the glands are always affected first, and soon become quite opaque, so as to appear black. For instance, I placed a leaf in a few drops of a strong solution, namely, of one part to 146 of water (or 3 grs. to 1 oz.), and observed it under a high power. All the glands began to * Judging from an account of M. Heckel’s observations, which I have only just seen quoted in the ‘Gardeners’ Chronicle’ (Oct. 10, 1874), he appears to have observed a similar phenomenon in the stamens of Berberis, after they have been excited by a touch and have moved; for he says, “the contents of each individual cell are collected together in the centre of the cavity.” [page 44] darken in 10 s. (seconds); and in 13 s. were conspicuously darker. In 1 m. extremely small spherical masses of protoplasm could be seen arising in the cells of the pedicels close beneath the glands, as well as in the cushions on which the long-headed marginal glands rest. In several cases the process travelled down the pedicels for a length twice or thrice as great as that of the glands, in about 10 m. It was interesting to observe the process momentarily arrested at each transverse partition between two cells, and then to see the transparent contents of the cell next below almost flashing into a cloudy mass. In the lower part of the pedicels, the action proceeded slower, so that it took about 20 m. before the cells halfway down the long marginal and submarginal tentacles became aggregated. We may infer that the carbonate of ammonia is absorbed by the glands, not only from its action being so rapid, but from its effect being somewhat different from that of other salts. As the glands, when excited, secrete an acid belonging to the acetic series, the carbonate is probably at once converted into a salt of this series; and we shall presently see that the acetate of ammonia causes aggregation almost or quite as energetically as does the carbonate. If a few drops of a solution of one part of the carbonate to 437 of water (or 1 gr. to 1 oz.) be added to the purple fluid which exudes from crushed tentacles, or to paper stained by being rubbed with them, the fluid and the paper are changed into a pale dirty green. Nevertheless, some purple colour could still be detected after 1 hr. 30 m. within the glands of a leaf left in a solution of twice the above strength (viz. 2 grs. to 1 oz.); and after 24 hrs. the cells of the pedicels close beneath the glands still contained spheres of protoplasm of a fine purple tint. These facts show that the ammonia had not entered as a carbonate, for otherwise the colour would have been discharged. I have, however, sometimes observed, especially with the long-headed tentacles on the margins of very pale leaves immersed in a solution, that the glands as well as the upper cells of the pedicels were discoloured; and in these cases I presume that the unchanged carbonate had been absorbed. The appearance above described, of the aggregating process being arrested for a short time at each transverse partition, impresses the mind with the idea of matter passing downwards from cell to cell. But as the cells one beneath the other undergo aggregation when inorganic and insoluble particles are placed on the glands, the process must be, at least in these cases, one of molecular change, transmitted from the glands, [page 45] independently of the absorption of any matter. So it may possibly be in the case of the carbonate of ammonia. As, however, the aggregation caused by this salt travels down the tentacles at a quicker rate than when insoluble particles are placed on the glands, it is probable that ammonia in some form is absorbed not only by the glands, but passes down the tentacles. Having examined a leaf in water, and found the contents of the cells homogeneous, I placed it in a few drops of a solution of one part of the carbonate to 437 of water, and attended to the cells immediately beneath the glands, but did not use a very high power. No aggregation was visible in 3 m.; but after 15 m. small spheres of protoplasm were formed, more especially beneath the long-headed marginal glands; the process, however, in this case took place with unusual slowness. In 25 m. conspicuous spherical masses were present in the cells of the pedicels for a length about equal to that of the glands; and in 3 hrs. to that of a third or half of the whole tentacle. If tentacles with cells containing only very pale pink fluid, and apparently but little protoplasm, are placed in a few drops of a weak solution of one part of the carbonate to 4375 of water (1 gr. to 10 oz.), and the highly transparent cells beneath the glands are carefully observed under a high power, these may be seen first to become slightly cloudy from the formation of numberless, only just perceptible, granules, which rapidly grow larger either from coalescence or from attracting more protoplasm from the surrounding fluid. On one occasion I chose a singularly pale leaf, and gave it, whilst under the microscope, a single drop of a stronger solution of one part to 437 of water; in this case the contents of the cells did not become cloudy, but after 10 m. minute irregular granules of protoplasm could be detected, which soon increased into irregular masses and globules of a greenish or very pale purple tint; but these never formed perfect spheres, though incessantly changing their shapes and positions. With moderately red leaves the first effect of a solution of the carbonate generally is the formation of two or three, or of several, extremely minute purple spheres which rapidly increase in size. To give an idea of the rate at which such spheres increase in size, I may mention that a rather pale purple leaf placed under a slip of glass was given a drop of a solution of one part to 292 of water, and in 13 m. a few minute spheres of protoplasm were formed; one of these, after 2 hrs. 30 m., was about two-thirds of the diameter of the cell. After 4 hrs. 25 m. [page 46] it nearly equalled the cell in diameter; and a second sphere about half as large as the first, together with a few other minute ones, were formed. After 6 hrs. the fluid in which these spheres floated was almost colourless. After 8 hrs. 35 m. (always reckoning from the time when the solution was first added) four new minute spheres had appeared. Next morning, after 22 hrs., there were, besides the two large spheres, seven smaller ones, floating in absolutely colourless fluid, in which some flocculent greenish matter was suspended. At the commencement of the process of aggregation, more especially in dark red leaves, the contents of the cells often present a different appearance, as if the layer of protoplasm (primordial utricle) which lines the cells had separated itself and shrunk from the walls; an irregularly shaped purple bag being thus formed. Other fluids, besides a solution of the carbonate, for instance an infusion of raw meat, produce this same effect. But the appearance of the primordial utricle shrinking from the walls is certainly false;* for before giving the solution, I saw on several occasions that the walls were lined with colourless flowing protoplasm, and after the bag-like masses were formed, the protoplasm was still flowing along the walls in a conspicuous manner, even more so than before. It appeared indeed as if the stream of protoplasm was strengthened by the action of the carbonate, but it was impossible to ascertain whether this was really the case. The bag-like masses, when once formed, soon begin to glide slowly round the cells, sometimes sending out projections which separate into little spheres; other spheres appear in the fluid surrounding the bags, and these travel much more quickly. That the small spheres are separate is often shown by sometimes one and then another travelling in advance, and sometimes they revolve round each other. I have occasionally seen spheres of this kind proceeding up and down the same side of a cell, instead of round it. The bag-like masses after a time generally divide into two rounded or oval masses, and these undergo the changes shown in figs. 7 and 8. At other times spheres appear within the bags; and these coalesce and separate in an endless cycle of change. After leaves have been left for several hours in a solution of the carbonate, and complete aggregation has been effected, the * With other plants I have often seen what appears to be a true shrinking of the primordial utricle from the walls of the cells, caused by a solution of carbonate of ammonia, as likewise follows from mechanical injuries. [page 47] stream of protoplasm on the walls of the cells ceases to be visible; I observed this fact repeatedly, but will give only one instance. A pale purple leaf was placed in a few drops of a solution of one part to 292 of water, and in 2 hrs. some fine purple spheres were formed in the upper cells of the pedicels, the stream of protoplasm round their walls being still quite distinct; but after an additional 4 hrs., during which time many more spheres were formed, the stream was no longer distinguishable on the most careful examination; and this no doubt was due to the contained granules having become united with the spheres, so that nothing was left by which the movement of the limpid protoplasm could be perceived. But minute free spheres still travelled up and down the cells, showing that there was still a current. So it was next morning, after 22 hrs., by which time some new minute spheres had been formed; these oscillated from side to side and changed their positions, proving that the current had not ceased, though no stream of protoplasm was visible. On another occasion, however, a stream was seen flowing round the cell-walls of a vigorous, dark-coloured leaf, after it had been left for 24 hrs. in a rather stronger solution, namely, of one part of the carbonate to 218 of water. This leaf, therefore, was not much or at all injured by an immersion for this length of time in the above solution of two grains to the ounce; and on being afterwards left for 24 hrs. in water, the aggregated masses in many of the cells were re-dissolved, in the same manner as occurs with leaves in a state of nature when they re-expand after having caught insects. In a leaf which had been left for 22 hrs. in a solution of one part of the carbonate to 292 of water, some spheres of protoplasm (formed by the self-division of a bag-like mass) were gently pressed beneath a covering glass, and then examined under a high power. They were now distinctly divided by well-defined radiating fissures, or were broken up into separate fragments with sharp edges; and they were solid to the centre. In the larger broken spheres the central part was more opaque, darker-coloured, and less brittle than the exterior; the latter alone being in some cases penetrated by the fissures. In many of the spheres the line of separation between the outer and inner parts was tolerably well defined. The outer parts were of exactly the same very pale purple tint, as that of the last formed smaller spheres; and these latter did not include any darker central core. From these several facts we may conclude that when vigorous dark-coloured leaves are subjected to the action of carbonate of [page 48] ammonia, the fluid within the cells of the tentacles often aggregates exteriorly into coherent viscid matter, forming a kind of bag. Small spheres sometimes appear within this bag, and the whole generally soon divides into two or more spheres, which repeatedly coalesce and redivide. After a longer or shorter time the granules in the colourless layer of protoplasm, which flows round the walls, are drawn to and unite with the larger spheres, or form small independent spheres; these latter being of a much paler colour, and more brittle than the first aggregated masses. After the granules of protoplasm have been thus attracted, the layer of flowing protoplasm can no longer be distinguished, though a current of limpid fluid still flows round the walls. If a leaf is immersed in a very strong, almost concentrated, solution of carbonate of ammonia, the glands are instantly blackened, and they secrete copiously; but no movement of the tentacles ensues. Two leaves thus treated became after 1 hr. flaccid, and seemed killed; all the cells in their tentacles contained spheres of protoplasm, but these were small and discoloured. Two other leaves were placed in a solution not quite so strong, and there was well-marked aggregation in 30 m. After 24 hrs. the spherical or more commonly oblong masses of protoplasm became opaque and granular, instead of being as usual translucent; and in the lower cells there were only innumerable minute spherical granules. It was evident that the strength of the solution had interfered with the completion of the process, as we shall see likewise follows from too great heat. All the foregoing observations relate to the exterior tentacles, which are of a purple colour; but the green pedicels of the short central tentacles are acted on by the carbonate, and by an infusion of raw meat, in exactly the same manner, with the sole difference that the aggregated masses are of a greenish colour; so that the process is in no way dependent on the colour of the fluid within the cells. Finally, the most remarkable fact with respect to this salt is the extraordinary small amount which suffices to cause aggregation. Full details will be given in the seventh chapter, and here it will be enough to say that with a sensitive leaf the absorption by a gland of 1/134400 of a grain (.000482 mgr.) is enough to cause in the course of one hour well-marked aggregation in the cells immediately beneath the gland. The Effects of certain other Salts and Fluids.—Two leaves were placed in a solution of one part of acetate of ammonia to about [page 49] 146 of water, and were acted on quite as energetically, but perhaps not quite so quickly, as by the carbonate. After 10 m. the glands were black, and in the cells beneath them there were traces of aggregation, which after 15 m. was well marked, extending down the tentacles for a length equal to that of the glands. After 2 hrs. the contents of almost all the cells in all the tentacles were broken up into masses of protoplasm. A leaf was immersed in a solution of one part of oxalate of ammonia to 146 of water; and after 24 m. some, but not a conspicuous, change could be seen within the cells beneath the glands. After 47 m. plenty of spherical masses of protoplasm were formed, and these extended down the tentacles for about the length of the glands. This salt, therefore, does not act so quickly as the carbonate. With respect to the citrate of ammonia, a leaf was placed in a little solution of the above strength, and there was not even a trace of aggregation in the cells beneath the glands, until 56 m. had elapsed; but it was well marked after 2 hrs. 20 m. On another occasion a leaf was placed in a stronger solution, of one part of the citrate to 109 of water (4 grs. to 1 oz.), and at the same time another leaf in a solution of the carbonate of the same strength. The glands of the latter were blackened in less than 2 m., and after 1 hr. 45 m. the aggregated masses, which were spherical and very dark-coloured, extended down all the tentacles, for between half and two-thirds of their lengths; whereas in the leaf immersed in the citrate the glands, after 30 m., were of a dark red, and the aggregated masses in the cells beneath them pink and elongated. After 1 hr. 45 m. these masses extended down for only about one-fifth or one-fourth of the length of the tentacles. Two leaves were placed, each in ten minims of a solution of one part of nitrate of ammonia to 5250 of water (1 gr. to 12 oz.), so that each leaf received 1/576 of a grain (.1124 mgr.). This quantity caused all the tentacles to be inflected, but after 24 hrs. there was only a trace of aggregation. One of these same leaves was then placed in a weak solution of the carbonate, and after 1 hr. 45 m. the tentacles for half their lengths showed an astonishing degree of aggregation. Two other leaves were then placed in a much stronger solution of one part of the nitrate to 146 of water (3 grs. to 1 oz.); in one of these there was no marked change after 3 hrs.; but in the other there was a trace of aggregation after 52 m., and this was plainly marked after 1 hr. 22 m., but even after 2 hrs. 12 m. there was certainly not more aggregation than would have fol- [page 50] lowed from an immersion of from 5 m. to 10 m. in an equally strong solution of the carbonate. Lastly, a leaf was placed in thirty minims of a solution of one part of phosphate of ammonia to 43,750 of water (1 gr. to 100 oz.), so that it received 1/1600 of a grain (.04079 mgr.); this soon caused the tentacles to be strongly inflected; and after 24 hrs. the contents of the cells were aggregated into oval and irregularly globular masses, with a conspicuous current of protoplasm flowing round the walls. But after so long an interval aggregation would have ensued, whatever had caused inflection. Only a few other salts, besides those of ammonia, were tried in relation to the process of aggregation. A leaf was placed in a solution of one part of chloride of sodium to 218 of water, and after 1 hr. the contents of the cells were aggregated into small, irregularly globular, brownish masses; these after 2 hrs. were almost disintegrated and pulpy. It was evident that the protoplasm had been injuriously affected; and soon afterwards some of the cells appeared quite empty. These effects differ altogether from those produced by the several salts of ammonia, as well as by various organic fluids, and by inorganic particles placed on the glands. A solution of the same strength of carbonate of soda and carbonate of potash acted in nearly the same manner as the chloride; and here again, after 2 hrs. 30 m., the outer cells of some of the glands had emptied themselves of their brown pulpy contents. We shall see in the eighth chapter that solutions of several salts of soda of half the above strength cause inflection, but do not injure the leaves. Weak solutions of sulphate of quinine, of nicotine, camphor, poison of the cobra, &c., soon induce well-marked aggregation; whereas certain other substances (for instance, a solution of curare) have no such tendency. Many acids, though much diluted, are poisonous; and though, as will be shown in the eighth chapter, they cause the tentacles to bend, they do not excite true aggregation. Thus leaves were placed in a solution of one part of benzoic acid to 437 of water; and in 15 m. the purple fluid within the cells had shrunk a little from the walls, yet when carefully examined after 1 hr. 20 m., there was no true aggregation; and after 24 hrs. the leaf was evidently dead. Other leaves in iodic acid, diluted to the same degree, showed after 2 hrs. 15 m. the same shrunken appearance of the purple fluid within the cells; and these, after 6 hrs. 15 m., were seen under a high power to be filled with excessively minute spheres of dull reddish protoplasm, [page 51] which by the next morning, after 24 hrs., had almost disappeared, the leaf being evidently dead. Nor was there any true aggregation in leaves immersed in propionic acid of the same strength; but in this case the protoplasm was collected in irregular masses towards the bases of the lower cells of the tentacles. A filtered infusion of raw meat induces strong aggregation, but not very quickly. In one leaf thus immersed there was a little aggregation after 1 hr. 20 m., and in another after 1 hr. 50 m. With other leaves a considerably longer time was required: for instance, one immersed for 5 hrs. showed no aggregation, but was plainly acted on in 5 m.; when placed in a few drops of a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 146 of water. Some leaves were left in the infusion for 24 hrs., and these became aggregated to a wonderful degree, so that the inflected tentacles presented to the naked eye a plainly mottled appearance. The little masses of purple protoplasm were generally oval or beaded, and not nearly so often spherical as in the case of leaves subjected to carbonate of ammonia. They underwent incessant changes of form; and the current of colourless protoplasm round the walls was conspicuously plain after an immersion of 25 hrs. Raw meat is too powerful a stimulant, and even small bits generally injure, and sometimes kill, the leaves to which they are given: the aggregated masses of protoplasm become dingy or almost colourless, and present an unusual granular appearance, as is likewise the case with leaves which have been immersed in a very strong solution of carbonate of ammonia. A leaf placed in milk had the contents of its cells somewhat aggregated in 1 hr. Two other leaves, one immersed in human saliva for 2 hrs. 30 m., and another in unboiled white of egg for 1 hr. 30 m., were not action on in this manner; though they undoubtedly would have been so, had more time been allowed. These same two leaves, on being afterwards placed in a solution of carbonate of ammonia (3 grs. to 1 oz.), had their cells aggregated, the one in 10 m. and the other in 5 m. Several leaves were left for 4 hrs. 30 m. in a solution of one part of white sugar to 146 of water, and no aggregation ensued; on being placed in a solution of this same strength of carbonate of ammonia, they were acted on in 5 m.; as was likewise a leaf which had been left for 1 hr. 45 m. in a moderately thick solution of gum arabic. Several other leaves were immersed for some hours in denser solutions of sugar, gum, and starch, and they had the contents of their cells greatly aggregated. This [page 52] effect may be attributed to exosmose; for the leaves in the syrup became quite flaccid, and those in the gum and starch somewhat flaccid, with their tentacles twisted about in the most irregular manner, the longer ones like corkscrews. We shall hereafter see that solutions of these substances, when placed on the discs of leaves, do not incite inflection. Particles of soft sugar were added to the secretion round several glands and were soon dissolved, causing a great increase of the secretion, no doubt by exosmose; and after 24 hrs. the cells showed a certain amount of aggregation, though the tentacles were not inflected. Glycerine causes in a few minutes well-pronounced aggregation, commencing as usual within the glands and then travelling down the tentacles; and this I presume may be attributed to the strong attraction of this substance for water. Immersion for several hours in water causes some degree of aggregation. Twenty leaves were first carefully examined, and re-examined after having been left immersed in distilled water for various periods, with the following results. It is rare to find even a trace of aggregation until 4 or 5 and generally not until several more hours have elapsed. When however a leaf becomes quickly inflected in water, as sometimes happens, especially during very warm weather, aggregation may occur in little over 1 hr. In all cases leaves left in water for more than 24 hrs. have their glands blackened, which shows that their contents are aggregated; and in the specimens which were carefully examined, there was fairly well-marked aggregation in the upper cells of the pedicels. These trials were made with cut off-leaves, and it occurred to me that this circumstance might influence the result, as the footstalks would not perhaps absorb water quickly enough to supply the glands as they continued to secrete. But this view was proved erroneous, for a plant with uninjured roots, bearing four leaves, was submerged in distilled water for 47 hrs., and the glands were blackened, though the tentacles were very little inflected. In one of these leaves there was only a slight degree of aggregation in the tentacles; in the second rather more, the purple contents of the cells being a little separated from the walls; in the third and fourth, which were pale leaves, the aggregation in the upper parts of the pedicels was well marked. In these leaves the little masses of protoplasm, many of which were oval, slowly changed their forms and positions; so that a submergence for 47 hrs. had not killed the protoplasm. In a previous trial with a submerged plant, the tentacles were not in the least inflected. [page 53] Heat induces aggregation. A leaf, with the cells of the tentacles containing only homogeneous fluid, was waved about for 1 m. in water at 130° Fahr. (54°.4 Cent.) and was then examined under the microscope as quickly as possible, that is in 2 m. or 3 m.; and by this time the contents of the cells had undergone some degree of aggregation. A second leaf was waved for 2 m. in water at 125° (51°.6 Cent.) and quickly examined as before; the tentacles were well inflected; the purple fluid in all the cells had shrunk a little from the walls, and contained many oval and elongated masses of protoplasm, with a few minute spheres. A third leaf was left in water at 125°, until it cooled, and when examined after 1 hr. 45 m., the inflected tentacles showed some aggregation, which became after 3 hrs. more strongly marked, but did not subsequently increase. Lastly, a leaf was waved for 1 m. in water at 120° (48°.8 Cent.) and then left for 1 hr. 26 m. in cold water; the tentacles were but little inflected, and there was only here and there a trace of aggregation. In all these and other trials with warm water the protoplasm showed much less tendency to aggregate into spherical masses than when excited by carbonate of ammonia. Redissolution of the Aggregated Masses of Protoplasm.—As soon as tentacles which have clasped an insect or any inorganic object, or have been in any way excited, have fully re-expanded, the aggregated masses of protoplasm are redissolved and disappear; the cells being now refilled with homogeneous purple fluid as they were before the tentacles were inflected. The process of redissolution in all cases commences at the bases of the tentacles, and proceeds up them towards the glands. In old leaves, however, especially in those which have been several times in action, the protoplasm in the uppermost cells of the pedicels remains in a permanently more or less aggregated condition. In order to observe the process of redissolution, the following observations were made: a leaf was left for 24 hrs. in a little solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 218 of water, and the protoplasm was as usual aggregated into numberless purple spheres, which were incessantly changing their forms. The leaf was then washed and placed in distilled water, and after 3 hrs. 15 m. some few of the spheres began to show by their less clearly defined edges signs of redissolution. After 9 hrs. many of them had become elongated, and the surrounding fluid in the cells was slightly more coloured, showing plainly that redissolution had commenced. After 24 hrs., though many cells still contained spheres, here and there one [page 54] could be seen filled with purple fluid, without a vestige of aggregated protoplasm; the whole having been redissolved. A leaf with aggregated masses, caused by its having been waved for 2 m. in water at the temperature of 125° Fahr., was left in cold water, and after 11 hrs. the protoplasm showed traces of incipient redissolution. When again examined three days after its immersion in the warm water, there was a conspicuous difference, though the protoplasm was still somewhat aggregated. Another leaf, with the contents of all the cells strongly aggregated from the action of a weak solution of phosphate of ammonia, was left for between three and four days in a mixture (known to be innocuous) of one drachm of alcohol to eight drachms of water, and when re-examined every trace of aggregation had disappeared, the cells being now filled with homogeneous fluid. We have seen that leaves immersed for some hours in dense solutions of sugar, gum, and starch, have the contents of their cells greatly aggregated, and are rendered more or less flaccid, with the tentacles irregularly contorted. These leaves, after being left for four days in distilled water, became less flaccid, with their tentacles partially re-expanded, and the aggregated masses of protoplasm were partially redissolved. A leaf with its tentacles closely clasped over a fly, and with the contents of the cells strongly aggregated, was placed in a little sherry wine; after 2 hrs. several of the tentacles had re-expanded, and the others could by a mere touch be pushed back into their properly expanded positions, and now all traces of aggregation had disappeared, the cells being filled with perfectly homogeneous pink fluid. The redissolution in these cases may, I presume, be attributed to endosmose.] _On the Proximate Causes of the Process of Aggregation._ As most of the stimulants which cause the inflection of the tentacles likewise induce aggregation in the contents of their cells, this latter process might be thought to be the direct result of inflection; but this is not the case. If leaves are placed in rather strong solutions of carbonate of ammonia, for instance of three or four, and even sometimes of only two grains to the ounce of water (i.e. one part to 109, or 146, or [page 55] 218, of water), the tentacles are paralysed, and do not become inflected, yet they soon exhibit strongly marked aggregation. Moreover, the short central tentacles of a leaf which has been immersed in a weak solution of any salt of ammonia, or in any nitrogenous organic fluid, do not become in the least inflected; nevertheless they exhibit all the phenomena of aggregation. On the other hand, several acids cause strongly pronounced inflection, but no aggregation. It is an important fact that when an organic or inorganic object is placed on the glands of the disc, and the exterior tentacles are thus caused to bend inwards, not only is the secretion from the glands of the latter increased in quantity and rendered acid, but the contents of the cells of their pedicels become aggregated. The process always commences in the glands, although these have not as yet touched any object. Some force or influence must, therefore, be transmitted from the central glands to the exterior tentacles, first to near their bases causing this part to bend, and next to the glands causing them to secrete more copiously. After a short time the glands, thus indirectly excited, transmit or reflect some influence down their own pedicels, inducing aggregation in cell beneath cell to their bases. It seems at first sight a probable view that aggregation is due to the glands being excited to secrete more copiously, so that sufficient fluid is not left in their cells, and in the cells of the pedicels, to hold the protoplasm in solution. In favour of this view is the fact that aggregation follows the inflection of the tentacles, and during the movement the glands generally, or, as I believe, always, secrete more copiously than they did before. Again, during the re-expansion [page 56] of the tentacles, the glands secrete less freely, or quite cease to secrete, and the aggregated masses of protoplasm are then redissolved. Moreover, when leaves are immersed in dense vegetable solutions, or in glycerine, the fluid within the gland-cells passes outwards, and there is aggregation; and when the leaves are afterwards immersed in water, or in an innocuous fluid of less specific gravity than water, the protoplasm is redissolved, and this, no doubt, is due to endosmose. Opposed to this view, that aggregation is caused by the outward passage of fluid from the cells, are the following facts. There seems no close relation between the degree of increased secretion and that of aggregation. Thus a particle of sugar added to the secretion round a gland causes a much greater increase of secretion, and much less aggregation, than does a particle of carbonate of ammonia given in the same manner. It does not appear probable that pure water would cause much exosmose, and yet aggregation often follows from an immersion in water of between 16 hrs. and 24 hrs., and always after from 24 hrs. to 48 hrs. Still less probable is it that water at a temperature of from 125° to 130° Fahr. (51°.6 to 54°.4 Cent.) should cause fluid to pass, not only from the glands, but from all the cells of the tentacles down to their bases, so quickly that aggregation is induced within 2 m. or 3 m. Another strong argument against this view is, that, after complete aggregation, the spheres and oval masses of protoplasm float about in an abundant supply of thin colourless fluid; so that at least the latter stages of the process cannot be due to the want of fluid to hold the protoplasm in solution. There is still stronger evidence that aggregation is independent of secretion; for the papillae, described in the first chapter, with which the [page 57] leaves are studded are not glandular, and do not secrete, yet they rapidly absorb carbonate of ammonia or an infusion of raw meat, and their contents then quickly undergo aggregation, which afterwards spreads into the cells of the surrounding tissues. We shall hereafter see that the purple fluid within the sensitive filaments of Dionaea, which do not secrete, likewise undergoes aggregation from the action of a weak solution of carbonate of ammonia. The process of aggregation is a vital one; by which I mean that the contents of the cells must be alive and uninjured to be thus affected, and they must be in an oxygenated condition for the transmission of the process at the proper rate. Some tentacles in a drop of water were strongly pressed beneath a slip of glass; many of the cells were ruptured, and pulpy matter of a purple colour, with granules of all sizes and shapes, exuded, but hardly any of the cells were completely emptied. I then added a minute drop of a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 109 of water, and after 1 hr. examined the specimens. Here and there a few cells, both in the glands and in the pedicels, had escaped being ruptured, and their contents were well aggregated into spheres which were constantly changing their forms and positions, and a current could still be seen flowing along the walls; so that the protoplasm was alive. On the other hand, the exuded matter, which was now almost colourless instead of being purple, did not exhibit a trace of aggregation. Nor was there a trace in the many cells which were ruptured, but which had not been completely emptied of their contents. Though I looked carefully, no signs of a current could be seen within these ruptured cells. They had evidently been killed by the pressure; and the matter which they [page 58] still contained did not undergo aggregation any more than that which had exuded. In these specimens, as I may add, the individuality of the life of each cell was well illustrated. A full account will be given in the next chapter of the effects of heat on the leaves, and I need here only state that leaves immersed for a short time in water at a temperature of 120° Fahr. (48°.8 Cent.), which, as we have seen, does not immediately induce aggregation, were then placed in a few drops of a strong solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 109 of water, and became finely aggregated. On the other hand, leaves, after an immersion in water at 150° (65°.5 Cent.), on being placed in the same strong solution, did not undergo aggregation, the cells becoming filled with brownish, pulpy, or muddy matter. With leaves subjected to temperatures between these two extremes of 120° and 150° Fahr. (48°.8 and 65°.5 Cent.), there were gradations in the completeness of the process; the former temperature not preventing aggregation from the subsequent action of carbonate of ammonia, the latter quite stopping it. Thus, leaves immersed in water, heated to 130° (54°.4 Cent.), and then in the solution, formed perfectly defined spheres, but these were decidedly smaller than in ordinary cases. With other leaves heated to 140° (60° Cent.), the spheres were extremely small, yet well defined, but many of the cells contained, in addition, some brownish pulpy matter. In two cases of leaves heated to 145° (62°.7 Cent.), a few tentacles could be found with some of their cells containing a few minute spheres; whilst the other cells and other whole tentacles included only the brownish, disintegrated or pulpy matter. The fluid within the cells of the tentacles must be in an oxygenated condition, in order that the force or [page 59] influence which induces aggregation should be transmitted at the proper rate from cell to cell. A plant, with its roots in water, was left for 45 m. in a vessel containing 122 oz. of carbonic acid. A leaf from this plant, and, for comparison, one from a fresh plant, were both immersed for 1 hr. in a rather strong solution of carbonate of ammonia. They were then compared, and certainly there was much less aggregation in the leaf which had been subjected to the carbonic acid than in the other. Another plant was exposed in the same vessel for 2 hrs. to carbonic acid, and one of its leaves was then placed in a solution of one part of the carbonate to 437 of water; the glands were instantly blackened, showing that they had absorbed, and that their contents were aggregated; but in the cells close beneath the glands there was no aggregation even after an interval of 3 hrs. After 4 hrs. 15 m. a few minute spheres of protoplasm were formed in these cells, but even after 5 hrs. 30 m. the aggregation did not extend down the pedicels for a length equal to that of the glands. After numberless trials with fresh leaves immersed in a solution of this strength, I have never seen the aggregating action transmitted at nearly so slow a rate. Another plant was left for 2 hrs. in carbonic acid, but was then exposed for 20 m. to the open air, during which time the leaves, being of a red colour, would have absorbed some oxygen. One of them, as well as a fresh leaf for comparison, were now immersed in the same solution as before. The former were looked at repeatedly, and after an interval of 65 m. a few spheres of protoplasm were first observed in the cells close beneath the glands, but only in two or three of the longer tentacles. After 3 hrs. the aggregation had travelled down the pedicels of a few of the tentacles [page 60] for a length equal to that of the glands. On the other hand, in the fresh leaf similarly treated, aggregation was plain in many of the tentacles after 15 m.; after 65 m. it had extended down the pedicels for four, five, or more times the lengths of the glands; and after 3 hrs. the cells of all the tentacles were affected for one-third or one-half of their entire lengths. Hence there can be no doubt that the exposure of leaves to carbonic acid either stops for a time the process of aggregation, or checks the transmission of the proper influence when the glands are subsequently excited by carbonate of ammonia; and this substance acts more promptly and energetically than any other. It is known that the protoplasm of plants exhibits its spontaneous movements only as long as it is in an oxygenated condition; and so it is with the white corpuscles of the blood, only as long as they receive oxygen from the red corpuscles;* but the cases above given are somewhat different, as they relate to the delay in the generation or aggregation of the masses of protoplasm by the exclusion of oxygen. A Summary and Concluding Remarks.—The process of aggregation is independent of the inflection of the tentacles and of increased secretion from the glands. It commences within the glands, whether these have been directly excited, or indirectly by a stimulus received from other glands. In both cases the process is transmitted from cell to cell down the whole length of the tentacles, being arrested for a short time at each transverse partition. With pale-coloured leaves the first change which is perceptible, but only * With respect to plants, Sachs, ‘Traité de Bot.’ 3rd edit., 1874, p. 864. On blood corpuscles, see ‘Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science,’ April 1874, p. 185.’ [page 61] under a high power, is the appearance of the finest granules in the fluid within the cells, making it slightly cloudy. These granules soon aggregate into small globular masses. I have seen a cloud of this kind appear in 10 s. after a drop of a solution of carbonate of ammonia had been given to a gland. With dark red leaves the first visible change often is the conversion of the outer layer of the fluid within the cells into bag-like masses. The aggregated masses, however they may have been developed, incessantly change their forms and positions. They are not filled with fluid, but are solid to their centres. Ultimately the colourless granules in the protoplasm which flows round the walls coalesce with the central spheres or masses; but there is still a current of limpid fluid flowing within the cells. As soon as the tentacles fully re-expand, the aggregated masses are redissolved, and the cells become filled with homogeneous purple fluid, as they were at first. The process of redissolution commences at the bases of the tentacles, thence proceeding upwards to the glands; and, therefore, in a reversed direction to that of aggregation. Aggregation is excited by the most diversified causes,—by the glands being several times touched,—by the pressure of particles of any kind, and as these are supported by the dense secretion, they can hardly press on the glands with the weight of a millionth of a grain,*—by the tentacles being cut off close beneath * According to Hofmeister (as quoted by Sachs, ‘Traité de Bot.’ 1874, p. 958), very slight pressure on the cell-membrane arrests immediately the movements of the protoplasm, and even determines its separation from the walls. But the process of aggregation is a different phenomenon, as it relates to the contents of the cells, and only secondarily to the layer of protoplasm which flows along the walls; though no doubt the effects of pressure or of a touch on the outside must be transmitted through this layer. [page 62] the glands,—by the glands absorbing various fluids or matter dissolved out of certain bodies,—by exosmose,—and by a certain degree of heat. On the other hand, a temperature of about 150° Fahr. (65°.5 Cent.) does not excite aggregation; nor does the sudden crushing of a gland. If a cell is ruptured, neither the exuded matter nor that which still remains within the cell undergoes aggregation when carbonate of ammonia is added. A very strong solution of this salt and rather large bits of raw meat prevent the aggregated masses being well developed. From these facts we may conclude that the protoplasmic fluid within a cell does not become aggregated unless it be in a living state, and only imperfectly if the cell has been injured. We have also seen that the fluid must be in an oxygenated state, in order that the process of aggregation should travel from cell to cell at the proper rate. Various nitrogenous organic fluids and salts of ammonia induce aggregation, but in different degrees and at very different rates. Carbonate of ammonia is the most powerful of all known substances; the absorption of 1/134400 of a grain (.000482 mg.) by a gland suffices to cause all the cells of the same tentacle to become aggregated. The first effect of the carbonate and of certain other salts of ammonia, as well as of some other fluids, is the darkening or blackening of the glands. This follows even from long immersion in cold distilled water. It apparently depends in chief part on the strong aggregation of their cell-contents, which thus become opaque, and do not reflect light. Some other fluids render the glands of a brighter red; whilst certain acids, though much diluted, the poison of the cobra-snake, &c., make the glands perfectly white and opaque; and this seems to depend on the coagulation of their contents without [page 63] any aggregation. Nevertheless, before being thus affected, they are able, at least in some cases, to excite aggregation in their own tentacles. That the central glands, if irritated, send centrifugally some influence to the exterior glands, causing them to send back a centripetal influence inducing aggregation, is perhaps the most interesting fact given in this chapter. But the whole process of aggregation is in itself a striking phenomenon. Whenever the peripheral extremity of a nerve is touched or pressed, and a sensation is felt, it is believed that an invisible molecular change is sent from one end of the nerve to the other; but when a gland of Drosera is repeatedly touched or gently pressed, we can actually see a molecular change proceeding from the gland down the tentacle; though this change is probably of a very different nature from that in a nerve. Finally, as so many and such widely different causes excite aggregation, it would appear that the living matter within the gland-cells is in so unstable a condition that almost any disturbance suffices to change its molecular nature, as in the case of certain chemical compounds. And this change in the glands, whether excited directly, or indirectly by a stimulus received from other glands, is transmitted from cell to cell, causing granules of protoplasm either to be actually generated in the previously limpid fluid or to coalesce and thus to become visible. Supplementary Observations on the Process of Aggregation in the Roots of Plants. It will hereafter be seen that a weak solution of the carbonate of ammonia induces aggregation in the cells of the roots of Drosera; and this led me to make a few trials on the roots of other plants. I dug up in the latter part of October the first weed which I met with, viz. Euphorbia peplus, being care- [page 64] ful not to injure the roots; these were washed and placed in a little solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 146 of water. In less than one minute I saw a cloud travelling from cell to cell up the roots, with wonderful rapidity. After from 8 m. to 9 m. the fine granules, which caused this cloudy appearance, became aggregated towards the extremities of the roots into quadrangular masses of brown matter; and some of these soon changed their forms and became spherical. Some of the cells, however, remained unaffected. I repeated the experiment with another plant of the same species, but before I could get the specimen into focus under the microscope, clouds of granules and quadrangular masses of reddish and brown matter were formed, and had run far up all the roots. A fresh root was now left for 18 hrs. in a drachm of a solution of one part of the carbonate to 437 of water, so that it received 1/8 of a grain, or 2.024 mg. When examined, the cells of all the roots throughout their whole length contained aggregated masses of reddish and brown matter. Before making these experiments, several roots were closely examined, and not a trace of the cloudy appearance or of the granular masses could be seen in any of them. Roots were also immersed for 35 m. in a solution of one part of carbonate of potash to 218 of water; but this salt produced no effect. I may here add that thin slices of the stem of the Euphorbia were placed in the same solution, and the cells which were green instantly became cloudy, whilst others which were before colourless were clouded with brown, owing to the formation of numerous granules of this tint. I have also seen with various kinds of leaves, left for some time in a solution of carbonate of ammonia, that the grains of chlorophyll ran together and partially coalesced; and this seems to be a form of aggregation. Plants of duck-weed (Lemna) were left for between 30 m. and 45 m. in a solution of one part of this same salt to 146 of water, and three of their roots were then examined. In two of them, all the cells which had previously contained only limpid fluid now included little green spheres. After from 1 1/2 hr. to 2 hrs. similar spheres appeared in the cells on the borders of the leaves; but whether the ammonia had travelled up the roots or had been directly absorbed by the leaves, I cannot say. As one species, Lemna arrhiza, produces no roots, the latter alternative is perhaps the most probable. After about 2 1/2 hrs. some of the little green spheres in the roots were broken up into small granules which exhibited Brownian movements. Some duck-weed was also left for 1 hr. 30 m. in a solution of one part of [page 65] carbonate of potash to 218 of water, and no decided change could be perceived in the cells of the roots; but when these same roots were placed for 25 m. in a solution of carbonate of ammonia of the same strength, little green spheres were formed. A green marine alga was left for some time in this same solution, but was very doubtfully affected. On the other hand, a red marine alga, with finely pinnated fronds, was strongly affected. The contents of the cells aggregated themselves into broken rings, still of a red colour, which very slowly and slightly changed their shapes, and the central spaces within these rings became cloudy with red granular matter. The facts here given (whether they are new, I know not) indicate that interesting results would perhaps be gained by observing the action of various saline solutions and other fluids on the roots of plants.

              " 'IV. THE EFFECTS OF HEAT ON THE LEAVES. Nature of the experiments—Effects of boiling water—Warm water causes rapid inflection—Water at a higher temperature does not cause immediate inflection, but does not kill the leaves, as shown by their subsequent re-expansion and by the aggregation of the protoplasm—A still higher temperature kills the leaves and coagulates the albuminous contents of the glands. In my observations on Drosera rotundifolia, the leaves seemed to be more quickly inflected over animal substances, and to remain inflected for a longer period during very warm than during cold weather. I wished, therefore, to ascertain whether heat alone would induce inflection, and what temperature was the most efficient. Another interesting point presented itself, namely, at what degree life was extinguished; for Drosera offers unusual facilities in this respect, not in the loss of the power of inflection, but in that of subsequent re-expansion, and more especially in the failure of the protoplasm to become aggregated, when the leaves after being heated are immersed in a solution of carbonate of ammonia.* * When my experiments on the effects of heat were made, I was not aware that the subject had been carefully investigated by several observers. For instance, Sachs is convinced (‘Traité de Botanique,’ 1874, pp. 772, 854) that the most different kinds of plants all perish if kept for 10 m. in water at 45° to 46° Cent., or 113° to 115° Fahr.; and he concludes that the protoplasm within their cells always coagulates, if in a damp condition, at a temperature of between 50° and 60° Cent., or 122° to 140° Fahr. Max Schultze and Kühne (as quoted by Dr. Bastian in ‘Contemp. Review,’ 1874, p. 528) “found that the protoplasm of plant-cells, with which they experimented, was always killed and [[page 67]] altered by a very brief exposure to a temperature of 118 1/2° Fahr. as a maximum.” As my results are deduced from special phenomena, namely, the subsequent aggregation of the protoplasm and the re-expansion of the tentacles, they seem to me worth giving. We shall find that Drosera resists heat somewhat better than most other plants. That there should be considerable differences in this respect is not surprising, considering that some low vegetable organisms grow in hot springs—cases of which have been collected by Prof. Wyman (‘American Journal of Science,’ vol. xliv. 1867). Thus, Dr. Hooker found Confervae in water at 168° Fahr.; Humboldt, at 185° Fahr.; and Descloizeaux, at 208° Fahr.) [page 67] [My experiments were tried in the following manner. Leaves were cut off, and this does not in the least interfere with their powers; for instance, three cut off leaves, with bits of meat placed on them, were kept in a damp atmosphere, and after 23 hrs. closely embraced the meat both with their tentacles and blades; and the protoplasm within their cells was well aggregated. Three ounces of doubly distilled water was heated in a porcelain vessel, with a delicate thermometer having a long bulb obliquely suspended in it. The water was gradually raised to the required temperature by a spirit-lamp moved about under the vessel; and in all cases the leaves were continually waved for some minutes close to the bulb. They were then placed in cold water, or in a solution of carbonate of ammonia. In other cases they were left in the water, which had been raised to a certain temperature, until it cooled. Again in other cases the leaves were suddenly plunged into water of a certain temperature, and kept there for a specified time. Considering that the tentacles are extremely delicate, and that their coats are very thin, it seems scarcely possible that the fluid contents of their cells should not have been heated to within a degree or two of the temperature of the surrounding water. Any further precautions would, I think, have been superfluous, as the leaves from age or constitutional causes differ slightly in their sensitiveness to heat. It will be convenient first briefly to describe the effects of immersion for thirty seconds in boiling water. The leaves are rendered flaccid, with their tentacles bowed backwards, which, as we shall see in a future chapter, is probably due to their outer surfaces retaining their elasticity for a longer period than their inner surfaces retain the power of contraction. The purple fluid within the cells of the pedicels is rendered finely granular, but there is no true aggregation; nor does this follow [page 68] when the leaves are subsequently placed in a solution of carbonate of ammonia. But the most remarkable change is that the glands become opaque and uniformly white; and this may be attributed to the coagulation of their albuminous contents. My first and preliminary experiment consisted in putting seven leaves in the same vessel of water, and warming it slowly up to the temperature of 110° Fahr. (43°.3 Cent.); a leaf being taken out as soon as the temperature rose to 80° (26°.6 Cent.), another at 85°, another at 90°, and so on. Each leaf, when taken out, was placed in water at the temperature of my room, and the tentacles of all soon became slightly, though irregularly, inflected. They were now removed from the cold water and kept in damp air, with bits of meat placed on their discs. The leaf which had been exposed to the temperature of 110o became in 15 m. greatly inflected; and in 2 hrs. every single tentacle closely embraced the meat. So it was, but after rather longer intervals, with the six other leaves. It appears, therefore, that the warm bath had increased their sensitiveness when excited by meat. I next observed the degree of inflection which leaves underwent within stated periods, whilst still immersed in warm water, kept as nearly as possible at the same temperature; but I will here and elsewhere give only a few of the many trials made. A leaf was left for 10 m. in water at 100° (37°.7 Cent.), but no inflection occurred. A second leaf, however, treated in the same manner, had a few of its exterior tentacles very slightly inflected in 6 m., and several irregularly but not closely inflected in 10 m. A third leaf, kept in water at 105° to 106° (40°.5 to 41°.1 Cent.), was very moderately inflected in 6 m. A fourth leaf, in water at 110° (43°.3 Cent.), was somewhat inflected in 4 m., and considerably so in from 6 to 7 m. Three leaves were placed in water which was heated rather quickly, and by the time the temperature rose to 115°-116° (46°.1 to 46°.06 Cent.), all three were inflected. I then removed the lamp, and in a few minutes every single tentacle was closely inflected. The protoplasm within the cells was not killed, for it was seen to be in distinct movement; and the leaves, having been left in cold water for 20 hrs., re-expanded. Another leaf was immersed in water at 100o (37.7° Cent.), which was raised to 120° (48°.8 Cent.); and all the tentacles, except the extreme marginal ones, soon became closely inflected. The leaf was now placed in cold water, and in 7 hrs. 30 m. it had partly, and in 10 hrs. fully, re-expanded. On the following morning it was immersed in a weak solution of carbonate of [page 69] ammonia, and the glands quickly became black, with strongly marked aggregation in the tentacles, showing that the protoplasm was alive, and that the glands had not lost their power of absorption. Another leaf was placed in water at 110o (43°.3 Cent.) which was raised to 120° (48°.8 Cent.); and every tentacle, excepting one, was quickly and closely inflected. This leaf was now immersed in a few drops of a strong solution of carbonate of ammonia (one part to 109 of water); in 10 m. all the glands became intensely black, and in 2 hrs. the protoplasm in the cells of the pedicels was well aggregated. Another leaf was suddenly plunged, and as usual waved about, in water at 120°, and the tentacles became inflected in from 2 m. to 3 m., but only so as to stand at right angles to the disc. The leaf was now placed in the same solution (viz. one part of carbonate of ammonia to 109 of water, or 4 grs. to 1 oz., which I will for the future designate as the strong solution), and when I looked at it again after the interval of an hour, the glands were blackened, and there was well-marked aggregation. After an additional interval of 4 hrs. the tentacles had become much more inflected. It deserves notice that a solution as strong as this never causes inflection in ordinary cases. Lastly a leaf was suddenly placed in water at 125° (51°.6 Cent.), and was left in it until the water cooled; the tentacles were rendered of a bright red and soon became inflected. The contents of the cells underwent some degree of aggregation, which in the course of three hours increased; but the masses of protoplasm did not become spherical, as almost always occurs with leaves immersed in a solution of carbonate of ammonia.] We learn from these cases that a temperature of from 120° to 125° (48°.8 to 51°.6 Cent.) excites the tentacles into quick movement, but does not kill the leaves, as shown either by their subsequent re-expansion or by the aggregation of the protoplasm. We shall now see that a temperature of 130° (54°.4 Cent.) is too high to cause immediate inflection, yet does not kill the leaves. [Experiment 1.—A leaf was plunged, and as in all cases waved about for a few minutes, in water at 130° (54°.4 Cent.), but there was no trace of inflection; it was then placed in cold water, and after an interval of 15 m. very slow movement was [page 70] distinctly seen in a small mass of protoplasm in one of the cells of a tentacle.* After a few hours all the tentacles and the blade became inflected. Experiment 2.—Another leaf was plunged into water at 130o to 131o, and as before there was no inflection. After being kept in cold water for an hour, it was placed in the strong solution of ammonia, and in the course of 55 m. the tentacles were considerably inflected. The glands, which before had been rendered of a brighter red, were now blackened. The protoplasm in the cells of the tentacles was distinctly aggregated; but the spheres were much smaller than those generated in unheated leaves when subjected to carbonate of ammonia. After an additional 2 hrs. all the tentacles, excepting six or seven, were closely inflected. Experiment 3.—A similar experiment to the last, with exactly the same results. Experiment 4.—A fine leaf was placed in water at 100° (37°.7 Cent.), which was then raised to 145° (62°.7 Cent.). Soon after immersion, there was, as might have been expected, strong inflection. The leaf was now removed and left in cold water; but from having been exposed to so high a temperature, it never re-expanded. Experiment 5.—Leaf immersed at 130° (54°.4 Cent.), and the water raised to 145° (62°.7 Cent.), there was no immediate inflection; it was then placed in cold water, and after 1 hr. 20 m. some of the tentacles on one side became inflected. This leaf was now placed in the strong solution, and in 40 m. all the submarginal tentacles were well inflected, and the glands blackened. After an additional interval of 2 hrs. 45 m. all the tentacles, except eight or ten, were closely inflected, with their cells exhibiting a slight degree of aggregation; but the spheres of protoplasm were very small, and the cells of the exterior tentacles contained some pulpy or disintegrated brownish matter. Experiments 6 and 7.—Two leaves were plunged in water at 135° (57°.2 Cent.) which was raised to 145° (62°.7 Cent.); neither became inflected. One of these, however, after having been left for 31 m. in cold water, exhibited some slight inflection, which increased after an additional interval of 1 hr. 45 m., until * Sachs states (‘Traité de Botanique,’ 1874, p. 855) that the movements of the protoplasm in the hairs of a Cucurbita ceased after they were exposed for 1 m. in water to a temperature of 47° to 48° Cent., or 117° to 119° Fahr. [page 71] all the tentacles, except sixteen or seventeen, were more or less inflected; but the leaf was so much injured that it never re-expanded. The other leaf, after having been left for half an hour in cold water, was put into the strong solution, but no inflection ensued; the glands, however, were blackened, and in some cells there was a little aggregation, the spheres of protoplasm being extremely small; in other cells, especially in the exterior tentacles, there was much greenish-brown pulpy matter. Experiment 8.—A leaf was plunged and waved about for a few minutes in water at 140° (60° Cent.), and was then left for half an hour in cold water, but there was no inflection. It was now placed in the strong solution, and after 2 hrs. 30 m. the inner submarginal tentacles were well inflected, with their glands blackened, and some imperfect aggregation in the cells of the pedicels. Three or four of the glands were spotted with the white porcelain-like structure, like that produced by boiling water. I have seen this result in no other instance after an immersion of only a few minutes in water at so low a temperature as 140°, and in only one leaf out of four, after a similar immersion at a temperature of 145° Fahr. On the other hand, with two leaves, one placed in water at 145° (62°.7 Cent.), and the other in water at 140° (60° Cent.), both being left therein until the water cooled, the glands of both became white and porcelain-like. So that the duration of the immersion is an important element in the result. Experiment 9.—A leaf was placed in water at 140° (60° Cent.), which was raised to 150° (65°.5 Cent.); there was no inflection; on the contrary, the outer tentacles were somewhat bowed backwards. The glands became like porcelain, but some of them were a little mottled with purple. The bases of the glands were often more affected than their summits. This leaf having been left in the strong solution did not undergo any inflection or aggregation. Experiment 10.—A leaf was plunged in water at 150° to 150 1/2° (65°.5 Cent.); it became somewhat flaccid, with the outer tentacles slightly reflexed, and the inner ones a little bent inwards, but only towards their tips; and this latter fact shows that the movement was not one of true inflection, as the basal part alone normally bends. The tentacles were as usual rendered of a very bright red, with the glands almost white like porcelain, yet tinged with pink. The leaf having been placed in the strong solution, the cell-contents of the tentacles became of a muddy-brown, with no trace of aggregation. [page 72] Experiment 11.—A leaf was immersed in water at 145° (62°.7 Cent.), which was raised to 156° (68°.8 Cent.). The tentacles became bright red and somewhat reflexed, with almost all the glands like porcelain; those on the disc being still pinkish, those near the margin quite white. The leaf being placed as usual first in cold water and then in the strong solution, the cells in the tentacles became of a muddy greenish brown, with the protoplasm not aggregated. Nevertheless, four of the glands escaped being rendered like porcelain, and the pedicels of these glands were spirally curled, like a French horn, towards their upper ends; but this can by no means be considered as a case of true inflection. The protoplasm within the cells of the twisted portions was aggregated into distinct though excessively minute purple spheres. This case shows clearly that the protoplasm, after having been exposed to a high temperature for a few minutes, is capable of aggregation when afterwards subjected to the action of carbonate of ammonia, unless the heat has been sufficient to cause coagulation.] Concluding Remarks.—As the hair-like tentacles are extremely thin and have delicate walls, and as the leaves were waved about for some minutes close to the bulb of the thermometer, it seems scarcely possible that they should not have been raised very nearly to the temperature which the instrument indicated. From the eleven last observations we see that a temperature of 130° (54°.4 Cent.) never causes the immediate inflection of the tentacles, though a temperature from 120° to 125° (48°.8 to 51°.6 Cent.) quickly produces this effect. But the leaves are paralysed only for a time by a temperature of 130°, as afterwards, whether left in simple water or in a solution of carbonate of ammonia, they become inflected and their protoplasm undergoes aggregation. This great difference in the effects of a higher and lower temperature may be compared with that from immersion in strong and weak solutions of the salts of ammonia; for the former do not excite movement, whereas the latter act energetically. A temporary suspension of the [page 73] power of movement due to heat is called by Sachs* heat-rigidity; and this in the case of the sensitive-plant (Mimosa) is induced by its exposure for a few minutes to humid air, raised to 120°-122° Fahr., or 49° to 50° Cent. It deserves notice that the leaves of Drosera, after being immersed in water at 130° Fahr., are excited into movement by a solution of the carbonate so strong that it would paralyse ordinary leaves and cause no inflection. The exposure of the leaves for a few minutes even to a temperature of 145° Fahr. (62°.7 Cent.) does not always kill them; as when afterwards left in cold water, or in a strong solution of carbonate of ammonia, they generally, though not always, become inflected; and the protoplasm within their cells undergoes aggregation, though the spheres thus formed are extremely small, with many of the cells partly filled with brownish muddy matter. In two instances, when leaves were immersed in water, at a lower temperature than 130° (54°.4 Cent.), which was then raised to 145° (62°.7 Cent.), they became during the earlier period of immersion inflected, but on being afterwards left in cold water were incapable of re-expansion. Exposure for a few minutes to a temperature of 145o sometimes causes some few of the more sensitive glands to be speckled with the porcelain-like appearance; and on one occasion this occurred at a temperature of 140° (60° Cent.). On another occasion, when a leaf was placed in water at this temperature of only 140o, and left therein till the water cooled, every gland became like porcelain. Exposure for a few minutes to a temperature of 150° (65°.5 Cent.) generally produces this effect, yet many glands retain a * ‘Traité de Bot.’ 1874, p. 1034. [page 74] pinkish colour, and many present a speckled appearance. This high temperature never causes true inflection; on the contrary, the tentacles commonly become reflexed, though to a less degree than when immersed in boiling water; and this apparently is due to their passive power of elasticity. After exposure to a temperature of 150° Fahr., the protoplasm, if subsequently subjected to carbonate of ammonia, instead of undergoing aggregation, is converted into disintegrated or pulpy discoloured matter. In short, the leaves are generally killed by this degree of heat; but owing to differences of age or constitution, they vary somewhat in this respect. In one anomalous case, four out of the many glands on a leaf, which had been immersed in water raised to 156° (68°.8 Cent.), escaped being rendered porcellanous;* and the protoplasm in the cells close beneath these glands underwent some slight, though imperfect, degree of aggregation. Finally, it is a remarkable fact that the leaves of Drosera rotundifolia, which flourishes on bleak upland moors throughout Great Britain, and exists (Hooker) within the Arctic Circle, should be able to withstand for even a short time immersion in water heated to a temperature of 145°.** It may be worth adding that immersion in cold * As the opacity and porcelain-like appearance of the glands is probably due to the coagulation of the albumen, I may add, on the authority of Dr. Burdon Sanderson, that albumen coagulates at about 155o, but, in presence of acids, the temperature of coagulation is lower. The leaves of Drosera contain an acid, and perhaps a difference in the amount contained may account for the slight differences in the results above recorded. ** It appears that cold-blooded animals are, as might have been expected, far more sensitive to an increase of temperature than is Drosera. Thus, as I hear from Dr. Burdon Sanderson, a frog begins to be distressed in water at a temperature of only 85° Fahr. At 95° the muscles become rigid, and the animal dies in a stiffened condition. [page 75] water does not cause any inflection: I suddenly placed four leaves, taken from plants which had been kept for several days at a high temperature, generally about 75° Fahr. (23°.8 Cent.), in water at 45° (7°.2 Cent.), but they were hardly at all affected; not so much as some other leaves from the same plants, which were at the same time immersed in water at 75°; for these became in a slight degree inflected.

              " 'V. THE EFFECTS OF NON-NITROGENOUS AND NITROGENOUS ORGANIC FLUIDS ON THE LEAVES. Non-nitrogenous fluids—Solutions of gum arabic—Sugar—Starch—Diluted alcohol—Olive oil— Infusion and decoction of tea—Nitrogenous fluids—Milk—Urine—Liquid albumen—Infusion of raw meat—Impure mucus—Saliva—Solution of isinglass—Difference in the action of these two sets of fluids—Decoction of green peas—Decoction and infusion of cabbage—Decoction of grass leaves. When, in 1860, I first observed Drosera, and was led to believe that the leaves absorbed nutritious matter from the insects which they captured, it seemed to me a good plan to make some preliminary trials with a few common fluids, containing and not containing nitrogenous matter; and the results are worth giving. In all the following cases a drop was allowed to fall from the same pointed instrument on the centre of the leaf; and by repeated trials one of these drops was ascertained to be on an average very nearly half a minim, or 1/960 of a fluid ounce, or .0295 ml. But these measurements obviously do not pretend to any strict accuracy; moreover, the drops of the viscid fluids were plainly larger than those of water. Only one leaf on the same plant was tried, and the plants were collected from two distant localities. The experiments were made during August and September. In judging of the effects, one caution is necessary: if a drop of any adhesive fluid is placed on an old or feeble leaf, the glands of which have ceased to secrete copiously, the drop sometimes dries up, especially if the plant [page 77] is kept in a room, and some of the central and submarginal tentacles are thus drawn together, giving to them the false appearance of having become inflected. This sometimes occurs with water, as it is rendered adhesive by mingling with the viscid secretion. Hence the only safe criterion, and to this alone I have trusted, is the bending inwards of the exterior tentacles, which have not been touched by the fluid, or at most only at their bases. In this case the movement is wholly due to the central glands having been stimulated by the fluid, and transmitting a motor impulse to the exterior tentacles. The blade of the leaf likewise often curves inwards, in the same manner as when an insect or bit of meat is placed on the disc. This latter movement is never caused, as far as I have seen, by the mere drying up of an adhesive fluid and the consequent drawing together of the tentacles. First for the non-nitrogenous fluids. As a preliminary trial, drops of distilled water were placed on between thirty and forty leaves, and no effect whatever was produced; nevertheless, in some other and rare cases, a few tentacles became for a short time inflected; but this may have been caused by the glands having been accidentally touched in getting the leaves into a proper position. That water should produce no effect might have been anticipated, as otherwise the leaves would have been excited into movement by every shower of rain. [Gum arabic.—Solutions of four degrees of strength were made; one of six grains to the ounce of water (one part to 73); a second rather stronger, yet very thin; a third moderately thick, and a fourth so thick that it would only just drop from a pointed instrument. These were tried on fourteen leaves; the drops being left on the discs from 24 hrs. to 44 hrs.; generally about [page 78] 30 hrs. Inflection was never thus caused. It is necessary to try pure gum arabic, for a friend tried a solution bought ready prepared, and this caused the tentacles to bend; but he afterwards ascertained that it contained much animal matter, probably glue. Sugar.—Drops of a solution of white sugar of three strengths (the weakest containing one part of sugar to 73 of water) were left on fourteen leaves from 32 hrs. to 48 hrs.; but no effect was produced. Starch.—A mixture about as thick as cream was dropped on six leaves and left on them for 30 hrs., no effect being produced. I am surprised at this fact, as I believe that the starch of commerce generally contains a trace of gluten, and this nitrogenous substance causes inflection, as we shall see in the next chapter. Alcohol, Diluted.—One part of alcohol was added to seven of water, and the usual drops were placed on the discs of three leaves. No inflection ensued in the course of 48 hrs. To ascertain whether these leaves had been at all injured, bits of meat were placed on them, and after 24 hrs. they were closely inflected. I also put drops of sherry-wine on three other leaves; no inflection was caused, though two of them seemed somewhat injured. We shall hereafter see that cut off leaves immersed in diluted alcohol of the above strength do not become inflected. Olive Oil.—drops were placed on the discs of eleven leaves, and no effect was produced in from 24 hrs. to 48 hrs. Four of these leaves were then tested by bits of meat on their discs, and three of them were found after 24 hrs. with all their tentacles and blades closely inflected, whilst the fourth had only a few tentacles inflected. It will, however, be shown in a future place, that cut off leaves immersed in olive oil are powerfully affected. Infusion and Decoction of Tea.—Drops of a strong infusion and decoction, as well as of a rather weak decoction, of tea were placed on ten leaves, none of which became inflected. I afterwards tested three of them by adding bits of meat to the drops which still remained on their discs, and when I examined them after 24 hrs. they were closely inflected. The chemical principle of tea, namely theine, was subsequently tried and produced no effect. The albuminous matter which the leaves must originally have contained, no doubt, had been rendered insoluble by their having been completely dried.] We thus see that, excluding the experiments with water, sixty-one leaves were tried with drops of the [page 79] above-named non-nitrogenous fluids; and the tentacles were not in a single case inflected. [With respect to nitrogenous fluids, the first which came to hand were tried. The experiments were made at the same time and in exactly the same manner as the foregoing. As it was immediately evident that these fluids produced a great effect, I neglected in most cases to record how soon the tentacles became inflected. But this always occurred in less than 24 hrs.; whilst the drops of non-nitrogenous fluids which produced no effect were observed in every case during a considerably longer period. Milk.—Drops were placed on sixteen leaves, and the tentacles of all, as well as the blades of several, soon became greatly inflected. The periods were recorded in only three cases, namely, with leaves on which unusually small drops had been placed. Their tentacles were somewhat inflected in 45 m.; and after 7 hrs. 45 m. the blades of two were so much curved inwards that they formed little cups enclosing the drops. These leaves re-expanded on the third day. On another occasion the blade of a leaf was much inflected in 5 hrs. after a drop of milk had been placed on it. Human Urine.—Drops were placed on twelve leaves, and the tentacles of all, with a single exception, became greatly inflected. Owing, I presume, to differences in the chemical nature of the urine on different occasions, the time required for the movements of the tentacles varied much, but was always effected in under 24 hrs. In two instances I recorded that all the exterior tentacles were completely inflected in 17 hrs., but not the blade of the leaf. In another case the edges of a leaf, after 25 hrs. 30 m., became so strongly inflected that it was converted into a cup. The power of urine does not lie in the urea, which, as we shall hereafter see, is inoperative. Albumen (fresh from a hen’s egg), placed on seven leaves, caused the tentacles of six of them to be well inflected. In one case the edge of the leaf itself became much curled in after 20 hrs. The one leaf which was unaffected remained so for 26 hrs., and was then treated with a drop of milk, and this caused the tentacles to bend inwards in 12 hrs. Cold Filtered Infusion of Raw Meat.—This was tried only on a single leaf, which had most of its outer tentacles and the blade inflected in 19 hrs. During subsequent years, I repeatedly used this infusion to test leaves which had been experimented [page 80] on with other substances, and it was found to act most energetically, but as no exact account of these trials was kept, they are not here introduced. Mucus.—Thick and thin mucus from the bronchial tubes, placed on three leaves, caused inflection. A leaf with thin mucus had its marginal tentacles and blade somewhat curved inward in 5 hrs. 30 m., and greatly so in 20 hrs. The action of this fluid no doubt is due either to the saliva or to some albuminous matter* mingled with it, and not, as we shall see in the next chapter, to mucin or the chemical principle of mucus. Saliva.—Human saliva, when evaporated, yields** from 1.14 to 1.19 per cent. of residue; and this yields 0.25 per cent. of ashes, so that the proportion of nitrogenous matter which saliva contains must be small. Nevertheless, drops placed on the discs of eight leaves acted on them all. In one case all the exterior tentacles, excepting nine, were inflected in 19 hrs. 30 m.; in another case a few became so in 2 hrs., and after 7 hrs. 30 m. all those situated near where the drop lay, as well as the blade, were acted on. Since making these trials, I have many scores of times just touched glands with the handle of my scalpel wetted with saliva, to ascertain whether a leaf was in an active condition; for this was shown in the course of a few minutes by the bending inwards of the tentacles. The edible nest of the Chinese swallow is formed of matter secreted by the salivary glands; two grains were added to one ounce of distilled water (one part to 218), which was boiled for several minutes, but did not dissolve the whole. The usual-sized drops were placed on three leaves, and these in 1 hr. 30 m. were well, and in 2 hrs. 15 m. closely, inflected. Isinglass.—Drops of a solution about as thick as milk, and of a still thicker solution, were placed on eight leaves, and the tentacles of all became inflected. In one case the exterior tentacles were well curved in after 6 hrs. 30 m., and the blade of the leaf to a partial extent after 24 hrs. As saliva acted so efficiently, and yet contains so small a proportion of nitrogenous matter, I tried how small a quantity of isinglass would act. One part was dissolved in 218 parts of distilled water, and drops were placed on four leaves. After 5 hrs. two of these were considerably and two moderately inflected; after 22 hrs. the former were greatly and the latter much more inflected. In the course of 48 hrs. * Mucus from the air-passages is said in Marshall, ‘Outlines of Physiology,’ vol. ii. 1867, p. 364, to contain some albumen. ** Müller’s ‘Elements of Physiology,’ Eng. Trans. vol. i., p. 514. [page 81] from the time when the drops were placed on the leaves, all four had almost re-expanded. They were then given little bits of meat, and these acted more powerfully than the solution. One part of isinglass was next dissolved in 437 of water; the fluid thus formed was so thin that it could not be distinguished from pure water. The usual-sized drops were placed on seven leaves, each of which thus received 1/960 of a grain (.0295 mg.). Three of them were observed for 41 hrs., but were in no way affected; the fourth and fifth had two or three of their exterior tentacles inflected after 18 hrs.; the sixth had a few more; and the seventh had in addition the edge of the leaf just perceptibly curved inwards. The tentacles of the four latter leaves began to re-expand after an additional interval of only 8 hrs. Hence the 1/960 of a grain of isinglass is sufficient to affect very slightly the more sensitive or active leaves. On one of the leaves, which had not been acted on by the weak solution, and on another, which had only two of its tentacles inflected, drops of the solution as thick as milk were placed; and next morning, after an interval of 16 hrs., both were found with all their tentacles strongly inflected.] Altogether I experimented on sixty-four leaves with the above nitrogenous fluids, the five leaves tried only with the extremely weak solution of isinglass not being included, nor the numerous trials subsequently made, of which no exact account was kept. Of these sixty-four leaves, sixty-three had their tentacles and often their blades well inflected. The one which failed was probably too old and torpid. But to obtain so large a proportion of successful cases, care must be taken to select young and active leaves. Leaves in this condition were chosen with equal care for the sixty-one trials with non-nitrogenous fluids (water not included); and we have seen that not one of these was in the least affected. We may therefore safely conclude that in the sixty-four experiments with nitrogenous fluids the inflection of the exterior tentacles was due to the absorption of [page 82] nitrogenous matter by the glands of the tentacles on the disc. Some of the leaves which were not affected by the non-nitrogenous fluids were, as above stated, immediately afterwards tested with bits of meat, and were thus proved to be in an active condition. But in addition to these trials, twenty-three of the leaves, with drops of gum, syrup, or starch, still lying on their discs, which had produced no effect in the course of between 24 hrs. and 48 hrs., were then tested with drops of milk, urine, or albumen. Of the twenty-three leaves thus treated, seventeen had their tentacles, and in some cases their blades, well inflected; but their powers were somewhat impaired, for the rate of movement was decidedly slower than when fresh leaves were treated with these same nitrogenous fluids. This impairment, as well as the insensibility of six of the leaves, may be attributed to injury from exosmose, caused by the density of the fluids placed on their discs. [The results of a few other experiments with nitrogenous fluids may be here conveniently given. Decoctions of some vegetables, known to be rich in nitrogen, were made, and these acted like animal fluids. Thus, a few green peas were boiled for some time in distilled water, and the moderately thick decoction thus made was allowed to settle. Drops of the superincumbent fluid were placed on four leaves, and when these were looked at after 16 hrs., the tentacles and blades of all were found strongly inflected. I infer from a remark by Gerhardt* that legumin is present in peas “in combination with an alkali, forming an incoagulable solution,” and this would mingle with boiling water. I may mention, in relation to the above and following experiments, that according to Schiff** certain forms of albumen * Watts’ ‘Dictionary of Chemistry,’ vol. iii., p. 568. ** ‘Leçons sur la Phys. de la Digestion,’ tom. i, p. 379; tom. ii. pp. 154, 166, on legumin. [page 83] exist which are not coagulated by boiling water, but are converted into soluble peptones. On three occasions chopped cabbage-leaves* were boiled in distilled water for 1 hr. or for 1 1/4 hr.; and by decanting the decoction after it had been allowed to rest, a pale dirty green fluid was obtained. The usual-sized drops were placed on thirteen leaves. Their tentacles and blades were inflected after 4 hrs. to a quite extraordinary degree. Next day the protoplasm within the cells of the tentacles was found aggregated in the most strongly marked manner. I also touched the viscid secretion round the glands of several tentacles with minute drops of the decoction on the head of a small pin, and they became well inflected in a few minutes. The fluid proving so powerful, one part was diluted with three of water, and drops were placed on the discs of five leaves; and these next morning were so much acted on that their blades were completely doubled over. We thus see that a decoction of cabbage-leaves is nearly or quite as potent as an infusion of raw meat. About the same quantity of chopped cabbage-leaves and of distilled water, as in the last experiment, were kept in a vessel for 20 hrs. in a hot closet, but not heated to near the boiling-point. Drops of this infusion were placed on four leaves. One of these, after 23 hrs., was much inflected; a second slightly; a third had only the submarginal tentacles inflected; and the fourth was not at all affected. The power of this infusion is therefore very much less than that of the decoction; and it is clear that the immersion of cabbage-leaves for an hour in water at the boiling temperature is much more efficient in extracting matter which excites Drosera than immersion during many hours in warm water. Perhaps the contents of the cells are protected (as Schiff remarks with respect to legumin) by the walls being formed of cellulose, and that until these are ruptured by boiling-water, but little of the contained albuminous matter is dissolved. We know from the strong odour of cooked cabbage-leaves that boiling water produces some chemical change in them, and that they are thus rendered far more digestible and nutritious to man. It is therefore an interesting * The leaves of young plants, before the heart is formed, such as were used by me, contain 2.1 per cent. of albuminous matter, and the outer leaves of mature plants 1.6 per cent. Watts’ ‘Dictionary of Chemistry,’ vol. i. p. 653. [page 84] fact that water at this temperature extracts matter from them which excites Drosera to an extraordinary degree. Grasses contain far less nitrogenous matter than do peas or cabbages. The leaves and stalks of three common kinds were chopped and boiled for some time in distilled water. Drops of this decoction (after having stood for 24 hrs.) were placed on six leaves, and acted in a rather peculiar manner, of which other instances will be given in the seventh chapter on the salts of ammonia. After 2 hrs. 30 m. four of the leaves had their blades greatly inflected, but not their exterior tentacles; and so it was with all six leaves after 24 hrs. Two days afterwards the blades, as well as the few submarginal tentacles which had been inflected, all re-expanded; and much of the fluid on their discs was by this time absorbed. It appears that the decoction strongly excites the glands on the disc, causing the blade to be quickly and greatly inflected; but that the stimulus, differently from what occurs in ordinary cases, does not spread, or only in a feeble degree, to the exterior tentacles. I may here add that one part of the extract of belladonna (procured from a druggist) was dissolved in 437 of water, and drops were placed on six leaves. Next day all six were somewhat inflected, and after 48 hrs. were completely re-expanded. It was not the included atropine which produced this effect, for I subsequently ascertained that it is quite powerless. I also procured some extract of hyoscyamus from three shops, and made infusions of the same strength as before. Of these three infusions, only one acted on some of the leaves, which were tried. Though druggists believe that all the albumen is precipitated in the preparation of these drugs, I cannot doubt that some is occasionally retained; and a trace would be sufficient to excite the more sensitive leaves of Drosera.

As we have seen that nitrogenous fluids act very differently on the leaves of Drosera from non-nitrogenous fluids, and as the leaves remain clasped for a much longer time over various organic bodies than over inorganic bodies, such as bits of glass, cinder, wood, &c., it becomes an interesting inquiry, whether they can only absorb matter already in solution, or render it soluble,—that is, have the power of digestion. We shall immediately see that they certainly have this power, and that they act on albuminous compounds in exactly the same manner as does the gastric juice of mammals; the digested matter being afterwards absorbed. This fact, which will be clearly proved, is a wonderful one in the physiology of plants. I must here state that I have been aided throughout all my later experiments by many valuable suggestions and assistance given me with the greatest kindness by Dr. Burdon Sanderson. [page 86] It may be well to premise for the sake of any reader who knows nothing about the digestion of albuminous compounds by animals that this is effected by means of a ferment, pepsin, together with weak hydrochloric acid, though almost any acid will serve. Yet neither pepsin nor an acid by itself has any such power.* We have seen that when the glands of the disc are excited by the contact of any object, especially of one containing nitrogenous matter, the outer tentacles and often the blade become inflected; the leaf being thus converted into a temporary cup or stomach. At the same time the discal glands secrete more copiously, and the secretion becomes acid. Moreover, they transmit some influence to the glands of the exterior tentacles, causing them to pour forth a more copious secretion, which also becomes acid or more acid than it was before. As this result is an important one, I will give the evidence. The secretion of many glands on thirty leaves, which had not been in any way excited, was tested with litmus paper; and the secretion of twenty-two of these leaves did not in the least affect the colour, whereas that of eight caused an exceedingly feeble and sometimes doubtful tinge of red. Two other old leaves, however, which appeared to have been inflected several times, acted much more decidedly on the paper. Particles of clean glass were then placed on five of the leaves, cubes of albumen on six, and bits of raw meat on three, on none of which was the secretion at this time in the least acid. After an interval of 24 hrs., when almost all the tentacles on * It appears, however, according to Schiff, and contrary to the opinion of some physiologists, that weak hydrochloric dissolves, though slowly, a very minute quantity of coagulated albumen. Schiff, ‘Phys. de la Digestion,’ tom. ii. 1867, p. 25. [page 87] these fourteen leaves had become more or less inflected, I again tested the secretion, selecting glands which had not as yet reached the centre or touched any object, and it was now plainly acid. The degree of acidity of the secretion varied somewhat on the glands of the same leaf. On some leaves, a few tentacles did not, from some unknown cause, become inflected, as often happens; and in five instances their secretion was found not to be in the least acid; whilst the secretion of the adjoining and inflected tentacles on the same leaf was decidedly acid. With leaves excited by particles of glass placed on the central glands, the secretion which collects on the disc beneath them was much more strongly acid than that poured forth from the exterior tentacles, which were as yet only moderately inflected. When bits of albumen (and this is naturally alkaline), or bits of meat were placed on the disc, the secretion collected beneath them was likewise strongly acid. As raw meat moistened with water is slightly acid, I compared its action on litmus paper before it was placed on the leaves, and afterwards when bathed in the secretion; and there could not be the least doubt that the latter was very much more acid. I have indeed tried hundreds of times the state of the secretion on the discs of leaves which were inflected over various objects, and never failed to find it acid. We may, therefore, conclude that the secretion from unexcited leaves, though extremely viscid, is not acid or only slightly so, but that it becomes acid, or much more strongly so, after the tentacles have begun to bend over any inorganic or organic object; and still more strongly acid after the tentacles have remained for some time closely clasped over any object. I may here remind the reader that the secretion [page 88] appears to be to a certain extent antiseptic, as it checks the appearance of mould and infusoria, thus preventing for a time the discoloration and decay of such substances as the white of an egg, cheese, &c. It therefore acts like the gastric juice of the higher animals, which is known to arrest putrefaction by destroying the microzymes. [As I was anxious to learn what acid the secretion contained, 445 leaves were washed in distilled water, given me by Prof. Frankland; but the secretion is so viscid that it is scarcely possible to scrape or wash off the whole. The conditions were also unfavourable, as it was late in the year and the leaves were small. Prof. Frankland with great kindness undertook to test the fluid thus collected. The leaves were excited by clean particles of glass placed on them 24 hrs. previously. No doubt much more acid would have been secreted had the leaves been excited by animal matter, but this would have rendered the analysis more difficult. Prof. Frankland informs me that the fluid contained no trace of hydrochloric, sulphuric, tartaric, oxalic, or formic acids. This having been ascertained, the remainder of the fluid was evaporated nearly to dryness, and acidified with sulphuric acid; it then evolved volatile acid vapour, which was condensed and digested with carbonate of silver. “The weight of the silver salt thus produced was only .37 gr., much too small a quantity for the accurate determination of the molecular weight of the acid. The number obtained, however, corresponded nearly with that of propionic acid; and I believe that this, or a mixture of acetic and butyric acids, were present in the liquid. The acid doubtless belongs to the acetic or fatty series.” Prof. Frankland, as well as his assistant, observed (and this is an important fact) that the fluid, “when acidified with sulphuric acid, emitted a powerful odour like that of pepsin.” The leaves from which the secretion had been washed were also sent to Prof. Frankland; they were macerated for some hours, then acidified with sulphuric acid and distilled, but no acid passed over. Therefore the acid which fresh leaves contain, as shown by their discolouring litmus paper when crushed, must be of a different nature from that present in the secretion. Nor was any odour of pepsin emitted by them. [page 89] Although it has long been known that pepsin with acetic acid has the power of digesting albuminous compounds, it appeared advisable to ascertain whether acetic acid could be replaced, without the loss of digestive power, by the allied acids which are believed to occur in the secretion of Drosera, namely, propionic, butyric, or valerianic. Dr. Burdon Sanderson was so kind as to make for me the following experiments, the results of which are valuable, independently of the present inquiry. Prof. Frankland supplied the acids. “1. The purpose of the following experiments was to determine the digestive activity of liquids containing pepsin, when acidulated with certain volatile acids belonging to the acetic series, in comparison with liquids acidulated with hydrochloric acid, in proportion similar to that in which it exists in gastric juice. “2. It has been determined empirically that the best results are obtained in artificial digestion when a liquid containing two per thousand of hydrochloric acid gas by weight is used. This corresponds to about 6.25 cubic centimetres per litre of ordinary strong hydrochloric acid. The quantities of propionic, butyric, and valerianic acids respectively which are required to neutralise as much base as 6.25 cubic centimetres of HCl, are in grammes 4.04 of propionic acid, 4.82 of butyric acid, and 5.68 of valerianic acid. It was therefore judged expedient, in comparing the digestive powers of these acids with that of hydrochloric acid, to use them in these proportions. “3. Five hundred cub. cent. of a liquid containing about 8 cub. cent. of a glycerine extract of the mucous membrane of the stomach of a dog killed during digestion having been prepared, 10 cub. cent. of it were evaporated and dried at 110o. This quantity yielded 0.0031 of residue. “4. Of this liquid four quantities were taken which were severally acidulated with hydrochloric, propionic, butyric, and valerianic acids, in the proportions above indicated. Each liquid was then placed in a tube, which was allowed to float in a water bath, containing a thermometer which indicated a temperature of 38° to 40° Cent. Into each, a quantity of unboiled fibrin was introduced, and the whole allowed to stand for four hours, the temperature being maintained during the whole time, and care being taken that each contained throughout an excess of fibrin. At the end of the period each liquid was filtered. Of the filtrate, which of course contained as much of the fibrin as had been digested during the four hours, [page 90] 10 cub. cent. were measured out and evaporated, and dried at 110° as before. The residues were respectively— “In the liquid containing hydrochloric acid 0.4079 ” ” propionic acid 0.0601 ” ” butyric acid 0.1468 ” ” valerianic acid 0.1254 “Hence, deducting from each of these the above-mentioned residue, left when the digestive liquid itself was evaporated, viz. 0.0031, we have, “For propionic acid 0.0570 ” butyric acid 0.1437 ” valerianic acid 0.1223 as compared with 0.4048 for hydrochloric acid; these several numbers expressing the quantities of fibrin by weight digested in presence of equivalent quantities of the respective acids under identical conditions. “The results of the experiment may be stated thus:—If 100 represent the digestive power of a liquid containing pepsin with the usual proportion of hydrochloric acid, 14.0, 35.4, and 30.2, will represent respectively the digestive powers of the three acids under investigation. “5. In a second experiment in which the procedure was in every respect the same, excepting that all the tubes were plunged into the same water-bath, and the residues dried at 115o C., the results were as follows:— “Quantity of fibrin dissolved in four hours by 10 cub. cent. of the liquid:— “Propionic acid 0.0563 Butyric acid 0.0835 Valerianic acid 0.0615 “The quantity digested by a similar liquid containing hydrochloric acid was 0.3376. Hence, taking this as 100, the following numbers represent the relative quantities digested by the other acids:— “Propionic acid 16.5 Butyric acid 24.7 Valerianic acid 16.1 “6. A third experiment of the same kind gave: [page 91] “Quantity of fibrin digested in four hours by 10 cub. cent. of the liquid:— “Hydrochloric acid 0.2915 Propionic acid 0.1490 Butyric acid 0.1044 Valerianic acid 0.0520 “Comparing, as before, the three last numbers with the first taken as 100, the digestive power of propionic acid is represented by 16.8; that of butyric acid by 35.8; and that of valerianic by 17.8. “The mean of these three sets of observations (hydrochloric acid being taken as 100) gives for “Propionic acid 15.8 Butyric acid 32.0 Valerianic acid 21.4 “7. A further experiment was made to ascertain whether the digestive activity of butyric acid (which was selected as being apparently the most efficacious) was relatively greater at ordinary temperatures than at the temperature of the body. It was found that whereas 10 cub. cent. of a liquid containing the ordinary proportion of hydrochloric acid digested 0.1311 gramme, a similar liquid prepared with butyric acid digested 0.0455 gramme of fibrin. “Hence, taking the quantities digested with hydrochloric acid at the temperature of the body as 100, we have the digestive power of hydrochloric acid at the temperature of 16° to 18° Cent. represented by 44.9; that of butyric acid at the same temperature being 15.6.” We here see that at the lower of these two temperatures, hydrochloric acid with pepsin digests, within the same time, rather less than half the quantity of fibrin compared with what it digests at the higher temperature; and the power of butyric acid is reduced in the same proportion under similar conditions and temperatures. We have also seen that butyric acid, which is much more efficacious than propionic or valerianic acids, digests with pepsin at the higher temperature less than a third of the fibrin which is digested at the same temperature by hydrochloric acid.] [page 92] I will now give in detail my experiments on the digestive power of the secretion of Drosera, dividing the substances tried into two series, namely those which are digested more or less completely, and those which are not digested. We shall presently see that all these substances are acted on by the gastric juice of the higher animals in the same manner. I beg leave to call attention to the experiments under the head albumen, showing that the secretion loses its power when neutralised by an alkali, and recovers it when an acid is added. Substances which are completely or partially digested by the Secretion of Drosera. Albumen.—After having tried various substances, Dr. Burdon Sanderson suggested to me the use of cubes of coagulated albumen or hard-boiled egg. I may premise that five cubes of the same size as those used in the following experiments were placed for the sake of comparison at the same time on wet moss close to the plants of Drosera. The weather was hot, and after four days some of the cubes were discoloured and mouldy, with their angles a little rounded; but they were not surrounded by a zone of transparent fluid as in the case of those undergoing digestion. Other cubes retained their angles and white colour. After eight days all were somewhat reduced in size, discoloured, with their angles much rounded. Nevertheless in four out of the five specimens, the central parts were still white and opaque. So that their state differed widely, as we shall see, from that of the cubes subjected to the action of the secretion. [Experiment 1. Rather large cubes of albumen were first tried; the tentacles were well inflected in 24 hrs.; after an [page 93] additional day the angles of the cubes were dissolved and rounded;* but the cubes were too large, so that the leaves were injured, and after seven days one died and the others were dying. Albumen which has been kept for four or five days, and which, it may be presumed, has begun to decay slightly, seems to act more quickly than freshly boiled eggs. As the latter were generally used, I often moistened them with a little saliva, to make the tentacles close more quickly. Experiment 2.—A cube of 1/10 of an inch (i.e. with each side 1/10 of an inch, or 2.54 mm. in length) was placed on a leaf, and after 50 hrs. it was converted into a sphere about 3/40 of an inch (1.905 mm.) in diameter, surrounded by perfectly transparent fluid. After ten days the leaf re-expanded, but there was still left on the disc a minute bit of albumen now rendered transparent. More albumen had been given to this leaf than could be dissolved or digested. Experiment 3.—Two cubes of albumen of 1/20 of an inch (1.27 mm.) were placed on two leaves. After 46 hrs. every atom of one was dissolved, and most of the liquefied matter was absorbed, the fluid which remained being in this, as in all other cases, very acid and viscid. The other cube was acted on at a rather slower rate. Experiment 4.—Two cubes of albumen of the same size as the last were placed on two leaves, and were converted in 50 hrs. into two large drops of transparent fluid; but when these were removed from beneath the inflected tentacles, and viewed by reflected light under the microscope, fine streaks of white opaque matter could be seen in the one, and traces of similar streaks in the other. The drops were replaced on the leaves, which re-expanded after 10 days; and now nothing was left except a very little transparent acid fluid. Experiment 5.—This experiment was slightly varied, so that the albumen might be more quickly exposed to the action of the secretion. Two cubes, each of about 1/40 of an inch (.635 mm.), were placed on the same leaf, and two similar cubes on another * In all my numerous experiments on the digestion of cubes of albumen, the angles and edges were invariably first rounded. Now, Schiff states (‘Leçons phys. de la Digestion,’ vol. ii. 1867, page 149) that this is characteristic of the digestion of albumen by the gastric juice of animals. On the other hand, he remarks “les dissolutions, en chimie, ont lieu sur toute la surface des corps en contact avec l’agent dissolvant.” [page 94] leaf. These were examined after 21 hrs. 30 m., and all four were found rounded. After 46 hrs. the two cubes on the one leaf were completely liquefied, the fluid being perfectly transparent; on the other leaf some opaque white streaks could still be seen in the midst of the fluid. After 72 hrs. these streaks disappeared, but there was still a little viscid fluid left on the disc; whereas it was almost all absorbed on the first leaf. Both leaves were now beginning to re-expand.] The best and almost sole test of the presence of some ferment analogous to pepsin in the secretion appeared to be to neutralise the acid of the secretion with an alkali, and to observe whether the process of digestion ceased; and then to add a little acid and observe whether the process recommenced. This was done, and, as we shall see, with success, but it was necessary first to try two control experiments; namely, whether the addition of minute drops of water of the same size as those of the dissolved alkalies to be used would stop the process of digestion; and, secondly, whether minute drops of weak hydrochloric acid, of the same strength and size as those to be used, would injure the leaves. The two following experiments were therefore tried:— Experiment 6.—Small cubes of albumen were put on three leaves, and minute drops of distilled water on the head of a pin were added two or three times daily. These did not in the least delay the process; for, after 48 hrs., the cubes were completely dissolved on all three leaves. On the third day the leaves began to re-expand, and on the fourth day all the fluid was absorbed. Experiment 7.—Small cubes of albumen were put on two leaves, and minute drops of hydrochloric acid, of the strength of one part to 437 of water, were added two or three times. This did not in the least delay, but seemed rather to hasten, the process of digestion; for every trace of the albumen disappeared in 24 hrs. 30 m. After three days the leaves partially re-expanded, and by this time almost all the viscid fluid on their discs was absorbed. It is almost superfluous to state that [page 95] cubes of albumen of the same size as those above used, left for seven days in a little hydrochloric acid of the above strength, retained all their angles as perfect as ever. Experiment 8.—Cubes of albumen (of 1/20 of an inch, or 2.54 mm.) were placed on five leaves, and minute drops of a solution of one part of carbonate of soda to 437 of water were added at intervals to three of them, and drops of carbonate of potash of the same strength to the other two. The drops were given on the head of a rather large pin, and I ascertained that each was equal to about 1/10 of a minim (.0059 ml.), so that each contained only 1/4800 of a grain (.0135 mg.) of the alkali. This was not sufficient, for after 46 hrs. all five cubes were dissolved. Experiment 9.—The last experiment was repeated on four leaves, with this difference, that drops of the same solution of carbonate of soda were added rather oftener, as often as the secretion became acid, so that it was much more effectually neutralised. And now after 24 hrs. the angles of three of the cubes were not in the least rounded, those of the fourth being so in a very slight degree. Drops of extremely weak hydrochloric acid (viz. one part to 847 of water) were then added, just enough to neutralise the alkali which was still present; and now digestion immediately recommenced, so that after 23 hrs. 30 m. three of the cubes were completely dissolved, whilst the fourth was converted into a minute sphere, surrounded by transparent fluid; and this sphere next day disappeared. Experiment 10.—Stronger solutions of carbonate of soda and of potash were next used, viz. one part to 109 of water; and as the same-sized drops were given as before, each drop contained 1/1200 of a grain (.0539 mg.) of either salt. Two cubes of albumen (each about 1/40 of an inch, or .635 mm.) were placed on the same leaf, and two on another. Each leaf received, as soon as the secretion became slightly acid (and this occurred four times within 24 hrs.), drops either of the soda or potash, and the acid was thus effectually neutralised. The experiment now succeeded perfectly, for after 22 hrs. the angles of the cubes were as sharp as they were at first, and we know from experiment 5 that such small cubes would have been completely rounded within this time by the secretion in its natural state. Some of the fluid was now removed with blotting-paper from the discs of the leaves, and minute drops of hydrochloric acid of the strength of the one part to 200 of water was added. Acid of this greater strength was used as the solutions of the alkalies were stronger. The [page 96] process of digestion now commenced, so that within 48 hrs. from the time when the acid was given the four cubes were not only completely dissolved, but much of the liquefied albumen was absorbed. Experiment 11.—Two cubes of albumen (1/40 of an inch, or .635 mm.) were placed on two leaves, and were treated with alkalies as in the last experiment, and with the same result; for after 22 hrs. they had their angles perfectly sharp, showing that the digestive process had been completely arrested. I then wished to ascertain what would be the effect of using stronger hydrochloric acid; so I added minute drops of the strength of 1 per cent. This proved rather too strong, for after 48 hrs. from the time when the acid was added one cube was still almost perfect, and the other only very slightly rounded, and both were stained slightly pink. This latter fact shows that the leaves were injured,* for during the normal process of digestion the albumen is not thus coloured, and we can thus understand why the cubes were not dissolved.] From these experiments we clearly see that the secretion has the power of dissolving albumen, and we further see that if an alkali is added, the process of digestion is stopped, but immediately recommences as soon as the alkali is neutralised by weak hydrochloric acid. Even if I had tried no other experiments than these, they would have almost sufficed to prove that the glands of Drosera secrete some ferment analogous to pepsin, which in presence of an acid gives to the secretion its power of dissolving albuminous compounds. Splinters of clean glass were scattered on a large number of leaves, and these became moderately inflected. They were cut off and divided into three lots; two of them, after being left for some time in a little distilled water, were strained, and some dis- * Sachs remarks (‘Traité de Bot.’ 1874, p. 774), that cells which are killed by freezing, by too great heat, or by chemical agents, allow all their colouring matter to escape into the surrounding water. [page 97] coloured, viscid, slightly acid fluid was thus obtained. The third lot was well soaked in a few drops of glycerine, which is well known to dissolve pepsin. Cubes of albumen (1/20 of an inch) were now placed in the three fluids in watch-glasses, some of which were kept for several days at about 90° Fahr. (32°.2 Cent.), and others at the temperature of my room; but none of the cubes were dissolved, the angles remaining as sharp as ever. This fact probably indicates that the ferment is not secreted until the glands are excited by the absorption of a minute quantity of already soluble animal matter,—a conclusion which is supported by what we shall hereafter see with respect to Dionaea. Dr. Hooker likewise found that, although the fluid within the pitchers of Nepenthes possesses extraordinary power of digestion, yet when removed from the pitchers before they have been excited and placed in a vessel, it has no such power, although it is already acid; and we can account for this fact only on the supposition that the proper ferment is not secreted until some exciting matter is absorbed. On three other occasions eight leaves were strongly excited with albumen moistened with saliva; they were then cut off, and allowed to soak for several hours or for a whole day in a few drops of glycerine. Some of this extract was added to a little hydrochloric acid of various strengths (generally one to 400 of water), and minute cubes of albumen were placed in the mixture.* In two of these trials the cubes were not in the least acted on; but in the third * As a control experiment bits of albumen were placed in the same glycerine with hydrochloric acid of the same strength; and the albumen, as might have been expected, was not in the least affected after two days. [page 98] the experiment was successful. For in a vessel containing two cubes, both were reduced in size in 3 hrs.; and after 24 hrs. mere streaks of undissolved albumen were left. In a second vessel, containing two minute ragged bits of albumen, both were likewise reduced in size in 3 hrs., and after 24 hrs. completely disappeared. I then added a little weak hydrochloric acid to both vessels, and placed fresh cubes of albumen in them; but these were not acted on. This latter fact is intelligible according to the high authority of Schiff,* who has demonstrated, as he believes, in opposition to the view held by some physiologists, that a certain small amount of pepsin is destroyed during the act of digestion. So that if my solution contained, as is probable, an extremely small amount of the ferment, this would have been consumed by the dissolution of the cubes of albumen first given; none being left when the hydrochloric acid was added. The destruction of the ferment during the process of digestion, or its absorption after the albumen had been converted into a peptone, will also account for only one out of the three latter sets of experiments having been successful. Digestion of Roast Meat.—Cubes of about 1/20 of an inch (1.27 mm.) of moderately roasted meat were placed on five leaves which became in 12 hrs. closely inflected. After 48 hrs. I gently opened one leaf, and the meat now consisted of a minute central sphere, partially digested and surrounded by a thick envelope of transparent viscid fluid. The whole, without being much disturbed, was removed and placed under the microscope. In the central part the transverse striae on the muscular fibres were quite distinct; and it was * ‘Leçons phys. de la Digestion,’ 1867, tom. ii. pp. 114-126. [page 99] interesting to observe how gradually they disappeared, when the same fibre was traced into the surrounding fluid. They disappeared by the striae being replaced by transverse lines formed of excessively minute dark points, which towards the exterior could be seen only under a very high power; and ultimately these points were lost. When I made these observations, I had not read Schiff’s account* of the digestion of meat by gastric juice, and I did not understand the meaning of the dark points. But this is explained in the following statement, and we further see how closely similar is the process of digestion by gastric juice and by the secretion of Drosera. “On a dit le suc gastrique faisait perdre à la fibre musculaire ses stries transversales. Ainsi énoncée, cette proposition pourrait donner lieu à une équivoque, car ce qui se perd, ce n’est que _l’aspect_ extérieur de la striature et non les éléments anatomiques qui la composent. On sait que les stries qui donnent un aspect si caractéristique à la fibre musculaire, sont le résultat de la juxtaposition et du parallélisme des corpuscules élémentaires, placés, à distances égales, dans l’intérieur des fibrilles contiguës. Or, dès que le tissu connectif qui relie entre elles les fibrilles élémentaires vient à se gonfler et à se dissoudre, et que les fibrilles elles-mêmes se dissocient, ce parallélisme est détruit et avec lui l’aspect, le phénomène optique des stries. Si, après la désagrégation des fibres, on examine au microscope les fibrilles élémentaires, on distingue encore très-nettement à leur intérieur les corpuscules, et on continue à les voir, de plus en plus pâles, jusqu’au moment où les fibrilles elles-mêmes se liquéfient et disparaissent dans le suc gastrique. Ce qui constitue la striature, à proprement parler, n’est donc pas détruit, avant la liquéfaction de la fibre charnue elle-même.” In the viscid fluid surrounding the central sphere of undigested meat there were globules of fat and little bits of fibro-elastic tissue; neither of which were in * ‘Leçons phys. de la Digestion,’ tom. ii. p. 145. [page 100] the least digested. There were also little free parallelograms of yellowish, highly translucent matter. Schiff, in speaking of the digestion of meat by gastric juice, alludes to such parallelograms, and says:— “Le gonflement par lequel commence la digestion de la viande, résulte de l’action du suc gastrique acide sur le tissu connectif qui se dissout d’abord, et qui, par sa liquéfaction, désagrége les fibrilles. Celles-ci se dissolvent ensuite en grande partie, mais, avant de passer à l’état liquide, elles tendent à se briser en petits fragments transversaux. Les ‘_sarcous elements_’ de Bowman, qui ne sont autre chose que les produits de cette division transversale des fibrilles élémentaires, peuvent être préparés et isolés à l’aide du suc gastrique, pourvu qu’on n’attend pas jusqu’à la liquéfaction complète du muscle.” After an interval of 72 hrs., from the time when the five cubes were placed on the leaves, I opened the four remaining ones. On two nothing could be seen but little masses of transparent viscid fluid; but when these were examined under a high power, fat-globules, bits of fibro-elastic tissue, and some few parallelograms of sarcous matter, could be distinguished, but not a vestige of transverse striae. On the other two leaves there were minute spheres of only partially digested meat in the centre of much transparent fluid. Fibrin.—Bits of fibrin were left in water during four days, whilst the following experiments were tried, but they were not in the least acted on. The fibrin which I first used was not pure, and included dark particles: it had either not been well prepared or had subsequently undergone some change. Thin portions, about 1/10 of an inch square, were placed on several leaves, and though the fibrin was soon liquefied, the whole was never dissolved. Smaller particles were then placed on four leaves, and minute [page 101] drops of hydrochloric acid (one part to 437 of water) were added; this seemed to hasten the process of digestion, for on one leaf all was liquified and absorbed after 20 hrs.; but on the three other leaves some undissolved residue was left after 48 hrs. It is remarkable that in all the above and following experiments, as well as when much larger bits of fibrin were used, the leaves were very little excited; and it was sometimes necessary to add a little saliva to induce complete inflection. The leaves, moreover, began to re-expand after only 48 hrs., whereas they would have remained inflected for a much longer time had insects, meat, cartilage, albumen, &c., been placed on them. I then tried some pure white fibrin, sent me by Dr. Burdon Sanderson. [Experiment 1.—Two particles, barely 1/20 of an inch (1.27 mm.) square, were placed on opposite sides of the same leaf. One of these did not excite the surrounding tentacles, and the gland on which it rested soon dried. The other particle caused a few of the short adjoining tentacles to be inflected, the more distant ones not being affected. After 24 hrs. both were almost, and after 72 hrs. completely, dissolved. Experiment 2.—The same experiment with the same result, only one of the two bits of fibrin exciting the short surrounding tentacles. This bit was so slowly acted on that after a day I pushed it on to some fresh glands. In three days from the time when it was first placed on the leaf it was completely dissolved. Experiment 3.—Bits of fibrin of about the same size as before were placed on the discs of two leaves; these caused very little inflection in 23 hrs., but after 48 hrs. both were well clasped by the surrounding short tentacles, and after an additional 24 hrs. were completely dissolved. On the disc of one of these leaves much clear acid fluid was left. Experiment 4.—Similar bits of fibrin were placed on the discs of two leaves; as after 2 hrs. the glands seemed rather dry, they were freely moistened with saliva; this soon caused strong inflection both of the tentacles and blades, with copious [page 102] secretion from the glands. In 18 hrs. the fibrin was completely liquefied, but undigested atoms still floated in the liquid; these, however, disappeared in under two additional days.] From these experiments it is clear that the secretion completely dissolves pure fibrin. The rate of dissolution is rather slow; but this depends merely on this substance not exciting the leaves sufficiently, so that only the immediately adjoining tentacles are inflected, and the supply of secretion is small. Syntonin.—This substance, extracted from muscle, was kindly prepared for me by Dr. Moore. Very differently from fibrin, it acts quickly and energetically. Small portions placed on the discs of three leaves caused their tentacles and blades to be strongly inflected within 8 hrs.; but no further observations were made. It is probably due to the presence of this substance that raw meat is too powerful a stimulant, often injuring or even killing the leaves. Areolar Tissue.—Small portions of this tissue from a sheep were placed on the discs of three leaves; these became moderately well inflected in 24 hrs., but began to re-expand after 48 hrs., and were fully re-expanded in 72 hrs., always reckoning from the time when the bits were first given. This substance, therefore, like fibrin, excites the leaves for only a short time. The residue left on the leaves, after they were fully re-expanded, was examined under a high power and found much altered, but, owing to the presence of a quantity of elastic tissue, which is never acted on, could hardly be said to be in a liquefied condition. Some areolar tissue free from elastic tissue was next procured from the visceral cavity of a toad, and moderately sized, as well as very small, bits were placed on five leaves. After 24 hrs. two of the bits [page 103] were completely liquefied; two others were rendered transparent, but not quite liquefied; whilst the fifth was but little affected. Several glands on the three latter leaves were now moistened with a little saliva, which soon caused much inflection and secretion, with the result that in the course of 12 additional hrs. one leaf alone showed a remnant of undigested tissue. On the discs of the four other leaves (to one of which a rather large bit had been given) nothing was left except some transparent viscid fluid. I may add that some of this tissue included points of black pigment, and these were not at all affected. As a control experiment, small portions of this tissue were left in water and on wet moss for the same length of time, and remained white and opaque. From these facts it is clear that areolar tissue is easily and quickly digested by the secretion; but that it does not greatly excite the leaves. Cartilage.—Three cubes (1/20 of an inch or 1.27 mm.) of white, translucent, extremely tough cartilage were cut from the end of a slightly roasted leg-bone of a sheep. These were placed on three leaves, borne by poor, small plants in my greenhouse during November; and it seemed in the highest degree improbable that so hard a substance would be digested under such unfavourable circumstances. Nevertheless, after 48 hrs., the cubes were largely dissolved and converted into minute spheres, surrounded by transparent, very acid fluid. Two of these spheres were completely softened to their centres; whilst the third still contained a very small irregularly shaped core of solid cartilage. Their surfaces were seen under the microscope to be curiously marked by prominent ridges, showing that the cartilage had been unequally corroded by the secretion. I need hardly [page 104] say that cubes of the same cartilage, kept in water for the same length of time, were not in the least affected. During a more favourable season, moderately sized bits of the skinned ear of a cat, which includes cartilage, areolar and elastic tissue, were placed on three leaves. Some of the glands were touched with saliva, which caused prompt inflection. Two of the leaves began to re-expand after three days, and the third on the fifth day. The fluid residue left on their discs was now examined, and consisted in one case of perfectly transparent, viscid matter; in the other two cases, it contained some elastic tissue and apparently remnants of half digested areolar tissue. Fibro-cartilage (from between the vertebrae of the tail of a sheep). Moderately sized and small bits (the latter about 1/20 of an inch) were placed on nine leaves. Some of these were well and some very little inflected. In the latter case the bits were dragged over the discs, so that they were well bedaubed with the secretion, and many glands thus irritated. All the leaves re-expanded after only two days; so that they were but little excited by this substance. The bits were not liquefied, but were certainly in an altered condition, being swollen, much more transparent, and so tender as to disintegrate very easily. My son Francis prepared some artificial gastric juice, which was proved efficient by quickly dissolving fibrin, and suspended portions of the fibro-cartilage in it. These swelled and became hyaline, exactly like those exposed to the secretion of Drosera, but were not dissolved. This result surprised me much, as two physiologists were of opinion that fibro-cartilage would be easily digested by gastric juice. I therefore asked Dr. Klein to examine the specimens; and [page 105] he reports that the two which had been subjected to artificial gastric juice were “in that state of digestion in which we find connective tissue when treated with an acid, viz. swollen, more or less hyaline, the fibrillar bundles having become homogeneous and lost their fibrillar structure.” In the specimens which had been left on the leaves of Drosera, until they re-expanded, “parts were altered, though only slightly so, in the same manner as those subjected to the gastric juice as they had become more transparent, almost hyaline, with the fibrillation of the bundles indistinct.” Fibro-cartilage is therefore acted on in nearly the same manner by gastric juice and by the secretion of Drosera. Bone.—Small smooth bits of the dried hyoidal bone of a fowl moistened with saliva were placed on two leaves, and a similarly moistened splinter of an extremely hard, broiled mutton-chop bone on a third leaf. These leaves soon became strongly inflected, and remained so for an unusual length of time; namely, one leaf for ten and the other two for nine days. The bits of bone were surrounded all the time by acid secretion. When examined under a weak power, they were found quite softened, so that they were readily penetrated by a blunt needle, torn into fibres, or compressed. Dr. Klein was so kind as to make sections of both bones and examine them. He informs me that both presented the normal appearance of decalcified bone, with traces of the earthy salts occasionally left. The corpuscles with their processes were very distinct in most parts; but in some parts, especially near the periphery of the hyoidal bone, none could be seen. Other parts again appeared amorphous, with even the longitudinal striation of bone not distinguishable. This amorphous structure, [page 106] as Dr. Klein thinks, may be the result either of the incipient digestion of the fibrous basis or of all the animal matter having been removed, the corpuscles being thus rendered invisible. A hard, brittle, yellowish substance occupied the position of the medulla in the fragments of the hyoidal bone. As the angles and little projections of the fibrous basis were not in the least rounded or corroded, two of the bits were placed on fresh leaves. These by the next morning were closely inflected, and remained so,—the one for six and the other for seven days,—therefore for not so long a time as on the first occasion, but for a much longer time than ever occurs with leaves inflected over inorganic or even over many organic bodies. The secretion during the whole time coloured litmus paper of a bright red; but this may have been due to the presence of the acid super-phosphate of lime. When the leaves re-expanded, the angles and projections of the fibrous basis were as sharp as ever. I therefore concluded, falsely as we shall presently see, that the secretion cannot touch the fibrous basis of bone. The more probable explanation is that the acid was all consumed in decomposing the phosphate of lime which still remained; so that none was left in a free state to act in conjunction with the ferment on the fibrous basis. Enamel and Dentine.—As the secretion decalcified ordinary bone, I determined to try whether it would act on enamel and dentine, but did not expect that it would succeed with so hard a substance as enamel. Dr. Klein gave me some thin transverse slices of the canine tooth of a dog; small angular fragments of which were placed on four leaves; and these were examined each succeeding day at the same hour. The results are, I think, worth giving in detail.] [page 107] [Experiment 1.—May 1st, fragment placed on leaf; 3rd, tentacles but little inflected, so a little saliva was added; 6th, as the tentacles were not strongly inflected, the fragment was transferred to another leaf, which acted at first slowly, but by the 9th closely embraced it. On the 11th this second leaf began to re-expand; the fragment was manifestly softened, and Dr. Klein reports, “a great deal of enamel and the greater part of the dentine decalcified.” Experiment 2.—May 1st, fragment placed on leaf; 2nd, tentacles fairly well inflected, with much secretion on the disc, and remained so until the 7th, when the leaf re-expanded. The fragment was now transferred to a fresh leaf, which next day (8th) was inflected in the strongest manner, and thus remained until the 11th, when it re-expanded. Dr. Klein reports, “a great deal of enamel and the greater part of the dentine decalcified.” Experiment 3.—May 1st, fragment moistened with saliva and placed on a leaf, which remained well inflected until 5th, when it re-expanded. The enamel was not at all, and the dentine only slightly, softened. The fragment was now transferred to a fresh leaf, which next morning (6th) was strongly inflected, and remained so until the 11th. The enamel and dentine both now somewhat softened; and Dr. Klein reports, “less than half the enamel, but the greater part of the dentine decalcified.” Experiment 4.—May 1st, a minute and thin bit of dentine, moistened with saliva, was placed on a leaf, which was soon inflected, and re-expanded on the 5th. The dentine had become as flexible as thin paper. It was then transferred to a fresh leaf, which next morning (6th) was strongly inflected, and reopened on the 10th. The decalcified dentine was now so tender that it was torn into shreds merely by the force of the re-expanding tentacles.] From these experiments it appears that enamel is attacked by the secretion with more difficulty than dentine, as might have been expected from its extreme hardness; and both with more difficulty than ordinary bone. After the process of dissolution has once commenced, it is carried on with greater ease; this may be inferred from the leaves, to which the fragments were transferred, becoming in all four cases strongly inflected in the course of a single day; whereas the first set of leaves acted much less quickly and [page 108] energetically. The angles or projections of the fibrous basis of the enamel and dentine (except, perhaps, in No. 4, which could not be well observed) were not in the least rounded; and Dr. Klein remarks that their microscopical structure was not altered. But this could not have been expected, as the decalcification was not complete in the three specimens which were carefully examined. Fibrous Basis of Bone.—I at first concluded, as already stated, that the secretion could not digest this substance. I therefore asked Dr. Burdon Sanderson to try bone, enamel, and dentine, in artificial gastric juice, and he found that they were after a considerable time completely dissolved. Dr. Klein examined some of the small lamellae, into which part of the skull of a cat became broken up after about a week’s immersion in the fluid, and he found that towards the edges the “matrix appeared rarefied, thus producing the appearance as if the canaliculi of the bone-corpuscles had become larger. Otherwise the corpuscles and their canaliculi were very distinct.” So that with bone subjected to artificial gastric juice complete decalcification precedes the dissolution of the fibrous basis. Dr. Burdon Sanderson suggested to me that the failure of Drosera to digest the fibrous basis of bone, enamel, and dentine, might be due to the acid being consumed in the decomposition of the earthy salts, so that there was none left for the work of digestion. Accordingly, my son thoroughly decalcified the bone of a sheep with weak hydrochloric acid; and seven minute fragments of the fibrous basis were placed on so many leaves, four of the fragments being first damped with saliva to aid prompt inflection. All seven leaves became inflected, but only very moderately, in the course of a day. [page 109] They quickly began to re-expand; five of them on the second day, and the other two on the third day. On all seven leaves the fibrous tissue was converted into perfectly transparent, viscid, more or less liquefied little masses. In the middle, however, of one, my son saw under a high power a few corpuscles, with traces of fibrillation in the surrounding transparent matter. From these facts it is clear that the leaves are very little excited by the fibrous basis of bone, but that the secretion easily and quickly liquefies it, if thoroughly decalcified. The glands which had remained in contact for two or three days with the viscid masses were not discoloured, and apparently had absorbed little of the liquefied tissue, or had been little affected by it. Phosphate of Lime.—As we have seen that the tentacles of the first set of leaves remained clasped for nine or ten days over minute fragments of bone, and the tentacles of the second set for six or seven days over the same fragments, I was led to suppose that it was the phosphate of lime, and not any included animal matter, which caused such long continued inflection. It is at least certain from what has just been shown that this cannot have been due to the presence of the fibrous basis. With enamel and dentine (the former of which contains only 4 per cent. of organic matter) the tentacles of two successive sets of leaves remained inflected altogether for eleven days. In order to test my belief in the potency of phosphate of lime, I procured some from Prof. Frankland absolutely free of animal matter and of any acid. A small quantity moistened with water was placed on the discs of two leaves. One of these was only slightly affected; the other remained closely inflected for ten days, when a few of the tentacles began to [page 110] re-expand, the rest being much injured or killed. I repeated the experiment, but moistened the phosphate with saliva to insure prompt inflection; one leaf remained inflected for six days (the little saliva used would not have acted for nearly so long a time) and then died; the other leaf tried to re-expand on the sixth day, but after nine days failed to do so, and likewise died. Although the quantity of phosphate given to the above four leaves was extremely small, much was left in every case undissolved. A larger quantity wetted with water was next placed on the discs of three leaves; and these became most strongly inflected in the course of 24 hrs. They never re-expanded; on the fourth day they looked sickly, and on the sixth were almost dead. Large drops of not very viscid fluid hung from their edges during the six days. This fluid was tested each day with litmus paper, but never coloured it; and this circumstance I do not understand, as the superphosphate of lime is acid. I suppose that some superphosphate must have been formed by the acid of the secretion acting on the phosphate, but that it was all absorbed and injured the leaves; the large drops which hung from their edges being an abnormal and dropsical secretion. Anyhow, it is manifest that the phosphate of lime is a most powerful stimulant. Even small doses are more or less poisonous, probably on the same principle that raw meat and other nutritious substances, given in excess, kill the leaves. Hence the conclusion, that the long continued inflection of the tentacles over fragments of bone, enamel, and dentine, is caused by the presence of phosphate of lime, and not of any included animal matter, is no doubt correct. Gelatine.—I used pure gelatine in thin sheets given [page 111] me by Prof. Hoffmann. For comparison, squares of the same size as those placed on the leaves were left close by on wet moss. These soon swelled, but retained their angles for three days; after five days they formed rounded, softened masses, but even on the eighth day a trace of gelatine could still be detected. Other squares were immersed in water, and these, though much swollen, retained their angles for six days. Squares of 1/10 of an inch (2.54 mm.), just moistened with water, were placed on two leaves; and after two or three days nothing was left on them but some acid viscid fluid, which in this and other cases never showed any tendency to regelatinise; so that the secretion must act on the gelatine differently to what water does, and apparently in the same manner as gastric juice.* Four squares of the same size as before were then soaked for three days in water, and placed on large leaves; the gelatine was liquefied and rendered acid in two days, but did not excite much inflection. The leaves began to re-expand after four or five days, much viscid fluid being left on their discs, as if but little had been absorbed. One of these leaves, as soon as it re-expanded, caught a small fly, and after 24 hrs. was closely inflected, showing how much more potent than gelatine is the animal matter absorbed from an insect. Some larger pieces of gelatine, soaked for five days in water, were next placed on three leaves, but these did not become much inflected until the third day; nor was the gelatine completely liquefied until the fourth day. On this day one leaf began to re-expand; the second on the fifth; and third on the sixth. These several facts * Dr. Lauder Brunton, ‘Handbook for the Phys. Laboratory,’ 1873, pp. 477, 487; Schiff, ‘Leçons phys. de la Digestion,’ 1867, p. 249. [page 112] prove that gelatine is far from acting energetically on Drosera. In the last chapter it was shown that a solution of isinglass of commerce, as thick as milk or cream, induces strong inflection. I therefore wished to compare its action with that of pure gelatine. Solutions of one part of both substances to 218 of water were made; and half-minim drops (.0296 ml.) were placed on the discs of eight leaves, so that each received 1/480 of a grain, or .135 mg. The four with the isinglass were much more strongly inflected than the other four. I conclude therefore that isinglass contains some, though perhaps very little, soluble albuminous matter. As soon as these eight leaves re-expanded, they were given bits of roast meat, and in some hours all became greatly inflected; again showing how much more meat excites Drosera than does gelatine or isinglass. This is an interesting fact, as it is well known that gelatine by itself has little power of nourishing animals.* Chondrin.—This was sent me by Dr. Moore in a gelatinous state. Some was slowly dried, and a small chip was placed on a leaf, and a much larger chip on a second leaf. The first was liquefied in a day; the larger piece was much swollen and softened, but was not completely liquefied until the third day. The undried jelly was next tried, and as a control experiment small cubes were left in water for four days and retained their angles. Cubes of the same size were placed on two leaves, and larger cubes on two other leaves. The tentacles and laminae of the latter were closely inflected after 22 hrs., but those of the * Dr. Lauder Brunton gives in the ‘Medical Record,’ January 1873, p. 36, an account of Voit’s view of the indirect part which gelatine plays in nutrition. [page 113] two leaves with the smaller cubes only to a moderate degree. The jelly on all four was by this time liquefied, and rendered very acid. The glands were blackened from the aggregation of their protoplasmic contents. In 46 hrs. from the time when the jelly was given, the leaves had almost re-expanded, and completely so after 70 hrs.; and now only a little slightly adhesive fluid was left unabsorbed on their discs. One part of chondrin jelly was dissolved in 218 parts of boiling water, and half-minim drops were given to four leaves; so that each received about 1/480 of a grain (.135 mg.) of the jelly; and, of course, much less of dry chondrin. This acted most powerfully, for after only 3 hrs. 30 m. all four leaves were strongly inflected. Three of them began to re-expand after 24 hrs., and in 48 hrs. were completely open; but the fourth had only partially re-expanded. All the liquefied chondrin was by this time absorbed. Hence a solution of chondrin seems to act far more quickly and energetically than pure gelatine or isinglass; but I am assured by good authorities that it is most difficult, or impossible, to know whether chondrin is pure, and if it contained any albuminous compound, this would have produced the above effects. Nevertheless, I have thought these facts worth giving, as there is so much doubt on the nutritious value of gelatine; and Dr. Lauder Brunton does not know of any experiments with respect to animals on the relative value of gelatine and chondrin. Milk.—We have seen in the last chapter that milk acts most powerfully on the leaves; but whether this is due to the contained casein or albumen, I know not. Rather large drops of milk excite so much secretion (which is very acid) that it sometimes trickles down [page 114] from the leaves, and this is likewise characteristic of chemically prepared casein. Minute drops of milk, placed on leaves, were coagulated in about ten minutes. Schiff denies* that the coagulation of milk by gastric juice is exclusively due to the acid which is present, but attributes it in part to the pepsin; and it seems doubtful whether with Drosera the coagulation can be wholly due to the acid, as the secretion does not commonly colour litmus paper until the tentacles have become well inflected; whereas the coagulation commences, as we have seen, in about ten minutes. Minute drops of skimmed milk were placed on the discs of five leaves; and a large proportion of the coagulated matter or curd was dissolved in 6 hrs. and still more completely in 8 hrs. These leaves re-expanded after two days, and the viscid fluid left on their discs was then carefully scraped off and examined. It seemed at first sight as if all the casein had not been dissolved, for a little matter was left which appeared of a whitish colour by reflected light. But this matter, when examined under a high power, and when compared with a minute drop of skimmed milk coagulated by acetic acid, was seen to consist exclusively of oil-globules, more or less aggregated together, with no trace of casein. As I was not familiar with the microscopical appearance of milk, I asked Dr. Lauder Brunton to examine the slides, and he tested the globules with ether, and found that they were dissolved. We may, therefore, conclude that the secretion quickly dissolves casein, in the state in which it exists in milk. Chemically Prepared Casein.—This substance, which * ‘Leçons,’ &c. tom. ii. page 151. [page 115] is insoluble in water, is supposed by many chemists to differ from the casein of fresh milk. I procured some, consisting of hard globules, from Messrs. Hopkins and Williams, and tried many experiments with it. Small particles and the powder, both in a dry state and moistened with water, caused the leaves on which they were placed to be inflected very slowly, generally not until two days had elapsed. Other particles, wetted with weak hydrochloric acid (one part to 437 of water) acted in a single day, as did some casein freshly prepared for me by Dr. Moore. The tentacles commonly remained inflected for from seven to nine days; and during the whole of this time the secretion was strongly acid. Even on the eleventh day some secretion left on the disc of a fully re-expanded leaf was strongly acid. The acid seems to be secreted quickly, for in one case the secretion from the discal glands, on which a little powdered casein had been strewed, coloured litmus paper, before any of the exterior tentacles were inflected. Small cubes of hard casein, moistened with water, were placed on two leaves; after three days one cube had its angles a little rounded, and after seven days both consisted of rounded softened masses, in the midst of much viscid and acid secretion; but it must not be inferred from this fact that the angles were dissolved, for cubes immersed in water were similarly acted on. After nine days these leaves began to re-expand, but in this and other cases the casein did not appear, as far as could be judged by the eye, much, if at all, reduced in bulk. According to Hoppe-Seyler and Lubavin* casein consists of an albuminous, with * Dr. Lauder Brunton, ‘Handbook for Phys. Lab.’ p. 529. [page 116] a non-albuminous, substance; and the absorption of a very small quantity of the former would excite the leaves, and yet not decrease the casein to a perceptible degree. Schiff asserts*—and this is an important fact for us—that “la casine purifie des chemistes est un corps presque compltement inattaquable par le suc gastrique.” So that here we have another point of accordance between the secretion of Drosera and gastric juice, as both act so differently on the fresh casein of milk, and on that prepared by chemists. A few trials were made with cheese; cubes of 1/20 of an inch (1.27 mm.) were placed on four leaves, and these after one or two days became well inflected, their glands pouring forth much acid secretion. After five days they began to re-expand, but one died, and some of the glands on the other leaves were injured. Judging by the eye, the softened and subsided masses of cheese, left on the discs, were very little or not at all reduced in bulk. We may, however, infer from the time during which the tentacles remained inflected,—from the changed colour of some of the glands,—and from the injury done to others, that matter had been absorbed from the cheese. Legumin.—I did not procure this substance in a separate state; but there can hardly be a doubt that it would be easily digested, judging from the powerful effect produced by drops of a decoction of green peas, as described in the last chapter. Thin slices of a dried pea, after being soaked in water, were placed on two leaves; these became somewhat inflected in the course of a single hour, and most strongly so in 21 hrs. They re-expanded after three or four days. * ‘Leçons’ &c. tom. ii. page 153. [page 117] The slices were not liquefied, for the walls of the cells, composed of cellulose, are not in the least acted on by the secretion. Pollen.—A little fresh pollen from the common pea was placed on the discs of five leaves, which soon became closely inflected, and remained so for two or three days. The grains being then removed, and examined under the microscope, were found discoloured, with the oil-globules remarkably aggregated. Many had their contents much shrunk, and some were almost empty. In only a few cases were the pollen-tubes emitted. There could be no doubt that the secretion had penetrated the outer coats of the grains, and had partially digested their contents. So it must be with the gastric juice of the insects which feed on pollen, without masticating it.* Drosera in a state of nature cannot fail to profit to a certain extent by this power of digesting pollen, as innumerable grains from the carices, grasses, rumices, fir-trees, and other wind-fertilised plants, which commonly grow in the same neighbourhood, will be inevitably caught by the viscid secretion surrounding the many glands. Gluten.—This substance is composed of two albuminoids, one soluble, the other insoluble in alcohol.** Some was prepared by merely washing wheaten flour in water. A provisional trial was made with rather large pieces placed on two leaves; these, after 21 hrs., were closely inflected, and remained so for four days, when one was killed and the other had its glands extremely blackened, but was not afterwards observed. * Mr. A.W. Bennett found the undigested coats of the grains in the intestinal canal of pollen-eating Diptera; see ‘Journal of Hort. Soc. of London,’ vol. iv. 1874, p. 158. ** Watts’ ‘Dict. of Chemistry,’ vol. ii. 1872, p. 873. [page 118] Smaller bits were placed on two leaves; these were only slightly inflected in two days, but afterwards became much more so. Their secretion was not so strongly acid as that of leaves excited by casein. The bits of gluten, after lying for three days on the leaves, were more transparent than other bits left for the same time in water. After seven days both leaves re-expanded, but the gluten seemed hardly at all reduced in bulk. The glands which had been in contact with it were extremely black. Still smaller bits of half putrid gluten were now tried on two leaves; these were well inflected in 24 hrs., and thoroughly in four days, the glands in contact being much blackened. After five days one leaf began to re-expand, and after eight days both were fully re-expanded, some gluten being still left on their discs. Four little chips of dried gluten, just dipped in water, were next tried, and these acted rather differently from fresh gluten. One leaf was almost fully re-expanded in three days, and the other three leaves in four days. The chips were greatly softened, almost liquefied, but not nearly all dissolved. The glands which had been in contact with them, instead of being much blackened, were of a very pale colour, and many of them were evidently killed. In not one of these ten cases was the whole of the gluten dissolved, even when very small bits were given. I therefore asked Dr. Burdon Sanderson to try gluten in artificial digestive fluid of pepsin with hydrochloric acid; and this dissolved the whole. The gluten, however, was acted on much more slowly than fibrin; the proportion dissolved within four hours being as 40.8 of gluten to 100 of fibrin. Gluten was also tried in two other digestive fluids, in which hydrochloric acid was replaced by propionic [page 119] and butyric acids, and it was completely dissolved by these fluids at the ordinary temperature of a room. Here, then, at last, we have a case in which it appears that there exists an essential difference in digestive power between the secretion of Drosera and gastric juice; the difference being confined to the ferment, for, as we have just seen, pepsin in combination with acids of the acetic series acts perfectly on gluten. I believe that the explanation lies simply in the fact that gluten is too powerful a stimulant (like raw meat, or phosphate of lime, or even too large a piece of albumen), and that it injures or kills the glands before they have had time to pour forth a sufficient supply of the proper secretion. That some matter is absorbed from the gluten, we have clear evidence in the length of time during which the tentacles remain inflected, and in the greatly changed colour of the glands. At the suggestion of Dr. Sanderson, some gluten was left for 15 hrs. in weak hydrochloric acid (.02 per cent.), in order to remove the starch. It became colourless, more transparent, and swollen. Small portions were washed and placed on five leaves, which were soon closely inflected, but to my surprise re-expanded completely in 48 hrs. A mere vestige of gluten was left on two of the leaves, and not a vestige on the other three. The viscid and acid secretion, which remained on the discs of the three latter leaves, was scraped off and examined by my son under a high power; but nothing could be seen except a little dirt, and a good many starch grains which had not been dissolved by the hydrochloric acid. Some of the glands were rather pale. We thus learn that gluten, treated with weak hydrochloric acid, is not so powerful or so enduring a [page 120] stimulant as fresh gluten, and does not much injure the glands; and we further learn that it can be digested quickly and completely by the secretion. [Globulin or Crystallin.—This substance was kindly prepared for me from the lens of the eye by Dr. Moore, and consisted of hard, colourless, transparent fragments. It is said* that globulin ought to “swell up in water and dissolve, for the most part forming a gummy liquid;” but this did not occur with the above fragments, though kept in water for four days. Particles, some moistened with water, others with weak hydrochloric acid, others soaked in water for one or two days, were placed on nineteen leaves. Most of these leaves, especially those with the long soaked particles, became strongly inflected in a few hours. The greater number re-expanded after three or four days; but three of the leaves remained inflected during one, two, or three additional days. Hence some exciting matter must have been absorbed; but the fragments, though perhaps softened in a greater degree than those kept for the same time in water, retained all their angles as sharp as ever. As globulin is an albuminous substance, I was astonished at this result; and my object being to compare the action of the secretion with that of gastric juice, I asked Dr. Burdon Sanderson to try some of the globulin used by me. He reports that “it was subjected to a liquid containing 0.2 per cent. of hydrochloric acid, and about 1 per cent. of glycerine extract of the stomach of a dog. It was then ascertained that this liquid was capable of digesting 1.31 of its weight of unboiled fibrin in 1 hr.; whereas, during the hour, only 0.141 of the above globulin was dissolved. In both cases an excess of the substance to be digested was subjected to the liquid.”** We thus see that within the same time less than one-ninth by weight of globulin than of fibrin was dissolved; and bearing in mind that pepsin with acids of the acetic series has only about one-third of the digestive power of pepsin with hydrochloric acid, it is not surprising that the fragments of * Watts’ ‘Dictionary of Chemistry,’ vol. ii. page 874. ** I may add that Dr. Sanderson prepared some fresh globulin by Schmidt’s method, and of this 0.865 was dissolved within the same time, namely, one hour; so that it was far more soluble than that which I used, though less soluble than fibrin, of which, as we have seen, 1.31 was dissolved. I wish that I had tried on Drosera globulin prepared by this method. [page 121] globulin were not corroded or rounded by the secretion of Drosera, though some soluble matter was certainly extracted from them and absorbed by the glands. Haematin.—Some dark red granules, prepared from bullock’s blood, were given me; these were found by Dr. Sanderson to be insoluble in water, acids, and alcohol, so that they were probably haematin, together with other bodies derived from the blood. Particles with little drops of water were placed on four leaves, three of which were pretty closely inflected in two days; the fourth only moderately so. On the third day the glands in contact with the haematin were blackened, and some of the tentacles seemed injured. After five days two leaves died, and the third was dying; the fourth was beginning to re-expand, but many of its glands were blackened and injured. It is therefore clear that matter had been absorbed which was either actually poisonous or of too stimulating a nature. The particles were much more softened than those kept for the same time in water, but, judging by the eye, very little reduced in bulk. Dr. Sanderson tried this substance with artificial digestive fluid, in the manner described under globulin, and found that whilst 1.31 of fibrin, only 0.456 of the haematin was dissolved in an hour; but the dissolution by the secretion of even a less amount would account for its action on Drosera. The residue left by the artificial digestive fluid at first yielded nothing more to it during several succeeding days.] _Substances which are not Digested by the Secretion._ All the substances hitherto mentioned cause prolonged inflection of the tentacles, and are either completely or at least partially dissolved by the secretion. But there are many other substances, some of them containing nitrogen, which are not in the least acted on by the secretion, and do not induce inflection for a longer time than do inorganic and insoluble objects. These unexciting and indigestible substances are, as far as I have observed, epidermic productions (such as bits of human nails, balls of hair, the quills of feathers), fibro-elastic tissue, mucin, pepsin, urea, chitine, chlorophyll, cellulose, gun-cotton, fat, oil, and starch. [page 122] To these may be added dissolved sugar and gum, diluted alcohol, and vegetable infusions not containing albumen, for none of these, as shown in the last chapter, excite inflection. Now, it is a remarkable fact, which affords additional and important evidence, that the ferment of Drosera is closely similar to or identical with pepsin, that none of these same substances are, as far as it is known, digested by the gastric juice of animals, though some of them are acted on by the other secretions of the alimentary canal. Nothing more need be said about some of the above enumerated substances, excepting that they were repeatedly tried on the leaves of Drosera, and were not in the least affected by the secretion. About the others it will be advisable to give my experiments. [Fibro-elastic Tissue.—We have already seen that when little cubes of meat, &c., were placed on leaves, the muscles, areolar tissue, and cartilage were completely dissolved, but the fibro-elastic tissue, even the most delicate threads, were left without the least signs of having been attacked. And it is well known that this tissue cannot be digested by the gastric juice of animals.* Mucin.—As this substance contains about 7 per cent. of nitrogen, I expected that it would have excited the leaves greatly and been digested by the secretion, but in this I was mistaken. From what is stated in chemical works, it appears extremely doubtful whether mucin can be prepared as a pure principle. That which I used (prepared by Dr. Moore) was dry and hard. Particles moistened with water were placed on four leaves, but after two days there was only a trace of inflection in the immediately adjoining tentacles. These leaves were then tried with bits of meat, and all four soon became strongly inflected. Some of the dried mucin was then soaked in water for two days, and little cubes of the proper size were placed on three leaves. After four days the tentacles * See, for instance, Schiff, ‘Phys. de la Digestion,’ 1867, tom. ii., p. 38. [page 123] round the margins of the discs were a little inflected, and the secretion collected on the disc was acid, but the exterior tentacles were not affected. One leaf began to re-expand on the fourth day, and all were fully re-expanded on the sixth. The glands which had been in contact with the mucin were a little darkened. We may therefore conclude that a small amount of some impurity of a moderately exciting nature had been absorbed. That the mucin employed by me did contain some soluble matter was proved by Dr. Sanderson, who on subjecting it to artificial gastric juice found that in 1 hr. some was dissolved, but only in the proportion of 23 to 100 of fibrin during the same time. The cubes, though perhaps rather softer than those left in water for the same time, retained their angles as sharp as ever. We may therefore infer that the mucin itself was not dissolved or digested. Nor is it digested by the gastric juice of living animals, and according to Schiff* it is a layer of this substance which protects the coats of the stomach from being corroded during digestion. Pepsin.—My experiments are hardly worth giving, as it is scarcely possible to prepare pepsin free from other albuminoids; but I was curious to ascertain, as far as that was possible, whether the ferment of the secretion of Drosera would act on the ferment of the gastric juice of animals. I first used the common pepsin sold for medicinal purposes, and afterwards some which was much purer, prepared for me by Dr. Moore. Five leaves to which a considerable quantity of the former was given remained inflected for five days; four of them then died, apparently from too great stimulation. I then tried Dr. Moore’s pepsin, making it into a paste with water, and placing such small particles on the discs of five leaves that all would have been quickly dissolved had it been meat or albumen. The leaves were soon inflected; two of them began to re-expand after only 20 hrs., and the other three were almost completely re-expanded after 44 hrs. Some of the glands which had been in contact with the particles of pepsin, or with the acid secretion surrounding them, were singularly pale, whereas others were singularly dark-coloured. Some of the secretion was scraped off and examined under a high power; and it abounded with granules undistinguishable from those of pepsin left in water for the same length of time. We may therefore infer, as highly probable (remembering what small quantities were given), that the ferment of Drosera does not act on or digest * ‘Leçons phys. de la Digestion,’ 1867, tom. ii., p. 304. [page 124] pepsin, but absorbs from it some albuminous impurity which induces inflection, and which in large quantity is highly injurious. Dr. Lauder Brunton at my request endeavoured to ascertain whether pepsin with hydrochloric acid would digest pepsin, and as far as he could judge, it had no such power. Gastric juice, therefore, apparently agrees in this respect with the secretion of Drosera. Urea.—It seemed to me an interesting inquiry whether this refuse of the living body, which contains much nitrogen, would, like so many other animal fluids and substances, be absorbed by the glands of Drosera and cause inflection. Half-minim drops of a solution of one part to 437 of water were placed on the discs of four leaves, each drop containing the quantity usually employed by me, namely 1/960 of a grain, or .0674 mg.; but the leaves were hardly at all affected. They were then tested with bits of meat, and soon became closely inflected. I repeated the same experiment on four leaves with some fresh urea prepared by Dr. Moore; after two days there was no inflection; I then gave them another dose, but still there was no inflection. These leaves were afterwards tested with similarly sized drops of an infusion of raw meat, and in 6 hrs. there was considerable inflection, which became excessive in 24 hrs. But the urea apparently was not quite pure, for when four leaves were immersed in 2 dr. (7.1 ml.) of the solution, so that all the glands, instead of merely those on the disc, were enabled to absorb any small amount of impurity in solution, there was considerable inflection after 24 hrs., certainly more than would have followed from a similar immersion in pure water. That the urea, which was not perfectly white, should have contained a sufficient quantity of albuminous matter, or of some salt of ammonia, to have caused the above effect, is far from surprising, for, as we shall see in the next chapter, astonishingly small doses of ammonia are highly efficient. We may therefore conclude that urea itself is not exciting or nutritious to Drosera; nor is it modified by the secretion, so as to be rendered nutritious, for, had this been the case, all the leaves with drops on their discs assuredly would have been well inflected. Dr. Lauder Brunton informs me that from experiments made at my request at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital it appears that urea is not acted on by artificial gastric juice, that is by pepsin with hydrochloric acid. Chitine.—The chitinous coats of insects naturally captured by the leaves do not appear in the least corroded. Small square pieces of the delicate wing and of the elytron of a Staphylinus [page 125] were placed on some leaves, and after these had re-expanded, the pieces were carefully examined. Their angles were as sharp as ever, and they did not differ in appearance from the other wing and elytron of the same insect which had been left in water. The elytron, however, had evidently yielded some nutritious matter, for the leaf remained clasped over it for four days; whereas the leaves with bits of the true wing re-expanded on the second day. Any one who will examine the excrement of insect-eating animals will see how powerless their gastric juice is on chitine. Cellulose.—I did not obtain this substance in a separate state, but tried angular bits of dry wood, cork, sphagnum moss, linen, and cotton thread. None of these bodies were in the least attacked by the secretion, and they caused only that moderate amount of inflection which is common to all inorganic objects. Gun-cotton, which consists of cellulose, with the hydrogen replaced by nitrogen, was tried with the same result. We have seen that a decoction of cabbage-leaves excites the most powerful inflection. I therefore placed two little square bits of the blade of a cabbage-leaf, and four little cubes cut from the midrib, on six leaves of Drosera. These became well inflected in 12 hrs., and remained so for between two and four days; the bits of cabbage being bathed all the time by acid secretion. This shows that some exciting matter, to which I shall presently refer, had been absorbed; but the angles of the squares and cubes remained as sharp as ever, proving that the framework of cellulose had not been attacked. Small square bits of spinach-leaves were tried with the same result; the glands pouring forth a moderate supply of acid secretion, and the tentacles remaining inflected for three days. We have also seen that the delicate coats of pollen grains are not dissolved by the secretion. It is well known that the gastric juice of animals does not attack cellulose. Chlorophyll.—This substance was tried, as it contains nitrogen. Dr. Moore sent me some preserved in alcohol; it was dried, but soon deliquesced. Particles were placed on four leaves; after 3 hrs. the secretion was acid; after 8 hrs. there was a good deal of inflection, which in 24 hrs. became fairly well marked. After four days two of the leaves began to open, and the other two were then almost fully re-expanded. It is therefore clear that this chlorophyll contained matter which excited the leaves to a moderate degree; but judging by the eye, little or none was dissolved; so that in a pure state it would not probably have been attacked by the secretion. Dr. Sanderson tried that which I [page 126] used, as well as some freshly prepared, with artificial digestive liquid, and found that it was not digested. Dr. Lauder Brunton likewise tried some prepared by the process given in the British Pharmacopoeia, and exposed it for five days at the temperature of 37° Cent. to digestive liquid, but it was not diminished in bulk, though the fluid acquired a slightly brown colour. It was also tried with the glycerine extract of pancreas with a negative result. Nor does chlorophyll seem affected by the intestinal secretions of various animals, judging by the colour of their excrement. It must not be supposed from these facts that the grains of chlorophyll, as they exist in living plants, cannot be attacked by the secretion; for these grains consist of protoplasm merely coloured by chlorophyll. My son Francis placed a thin slice of spinach leaf, moistened with saliva, on a leaf of Drosera, and other slices on damp cotton-wool, all exposed to the same temperature. After 19 hrs. the slice on the leaf of Drosera was bathed in much secretion from the inflected tentacles, and was now examined under the microscope. No perfect grains of chlorophyll could be distinguished; some were shrunken, of a yellowish-green colour, and collected in the middle of the cells; others were disintegrated and formed a yellowish mass, likewise in the middle of the cells. On the other hand, in the slices surrounded by damp cotton-wool, the grains of chlorophyll were green and as perfect as ever. My son also placed some slices in artificial gastric juice, and these were acted on in nearly the same manner as by the secretion. We have seen that bits of fresh cabbage and spinach leaves cause the tentacles to be inflected and the glands to pour forth much acid secretion; and there can be little doubt that it is the protoplasm forming the grains of chlorophyll, as well as that lining the walls of the cells, which excites the leaves. Fat and Oil.—Cubes of almost pure uncooked fat, placed on several leaves, did not have their angles in the least rounded. We have also seen that the oil-globules in milk are not digested. Nor does olive oil dropped on the discs of leaves cause any inflection; but when they are immersed in olive oil, they become strongly inflected; but to this subject I shall have to recur. Oily substances are not digested by the gastric juice of animals. Starch.—Rather large bits of dry starch caused well-marked inflection, and the leaves did not re-expand until the fourth day; but I have no doubt that this was due to the prolonged irritation of the glands, as the starch continued to absorb the secretion. The particles were not in the least reduced in size; [page 127] and we know that leaves immersed in an emulsion of starch are not at all affected. I need hardly say that starch is not digested by the gastric juice of animals. Action of the Secretion on Living Seeds. The results of some experiments on living seeds, selected by hazard, may here be given, though they bear only indirectly on our present subject of digestion. Seven cabbage seeds of the previous year were placed on the same number of leaves. Some of these leaves were moderately, but the greater number only slightly inflected, and most of them re-expanded on the third day. One, however, remained clasped till the fourth, and another till the fifth day. These leaves therefore were excited somewhat more by the seeds than by inorganic objects of the same size. After they re-expanded, the seeds were placed under favourable conditions on damp sand; other seeds of the same lot being tried at the same time in the same manner, and found to germinate well. Of the seven seeds which had been exposed to the secretion, only three germinated; and one of the three seedlings soon perished, the tip of its radicle being from the first decayed, and the edges of its cotyledons of a dark brown colour; so that altogether five out of the seven seeds ultimately perished. Radish seeds (Raphanus sativus) of the previous year were placed on three leaves, which became moderately inflected, and re-expanded on the third or fourth day. Two of these seeds were transferred to damp sand; only one germinated, and that very slowly. This seedling had an extremely short, crooked, diseased, radicle, with no absorbent hairs; and the cotyledons were oddly mottled with purple, with the edges blackened and partly withered. Cress seeds (Lepidum sativum) of the previous year were placed on four leaves; two of these next morning were moderately and two strongly inflected, and remained so for four, five, and even six days. Soon after these seeds were placed on the leaves and had become damp, they secreted in the usual manner a layer of tenacious mucus; and to ascertain whether it was the absorption of this substance by the glands which caused so much inflection, two seeds were put into water, and as much of the mucus as possible scraped off. They were then placed on leaves, which became very strongly inflected in the course of 3 hrs., and were still closely inflected on the third day; so that it evidently was not the mucus which excited so [page 128] much inflection; on the contrary, this served to a certain extent as a protection to the seeds. Two of the six seeds germinated whilst still lying on the leaves, but the seedlings, when transferred to damp sand, soon died; of the other four seeds, only one germinated. Two seeds of mustard (Sinapis nigra), two of celery (Apium graveolens)—both of the previous year, two seeds well soaked of caraway (Carum carui), and two of wheat, did not excite the leaves more than inorganic objects often do. Five seeds, hardly ripe, of a buttercup (Ranunculus), and two fresh seeds of Anemone nemorosa, induced only a little more effect. On the other hand, four seeds, perhaps not quite ripe, of Carex sylvatica caused the leaves on which they were placed to be very strongly inflected; and these only began to re-expand on the third day, one remaining inflected for seven days. It follows from these few facts that different kinds of seeds excite the leaves in very different degrees; whether this is solely due to the nature of their coats is not clear. In the case of the cress seeds, the partial removal of the layer of mucus hastened the inflection of the tentacles. Whenever the leaves remain inflected during several days over seeds, it is clear that they absorb some matter from them. That the secretion penetrates their coats is also evident from the large proportion of cabbage, raddish, and cress seeds which were killed, and from several of the seedlings being greatly injured. This injury to the seeds and seedlings may, however, be due solely to the acid of the secretion, and not to any process of digestion; for Mr. Traherne Moggridge has shown that very weak acids of the acetic series are highly injurious to seeds. It never occurred to me to observe whether seeds are often blown on to the viscid leaves of plants growing in a state of nature; but this can hardly fail sometimes to occur, as we shall hereafter see in the case of Pinguicula. If so, Drosera will profit to a slight degree by absorbing matter from such seeds.] A Summary and Concluding Remarks on the Digestive Power of Drosera. When the glands on the disc are excited either by the absorption of nitrogenous matter or by mechanical irritation, their secretion increases in quantity and becomes acid. They likewise transmit [page 129] some influence to the glands of the exterior tentacles, causing them to secrete more copiously; and their secretion likewise becomes acid. With animals, according to Schiff,* mechanical irritation excites the glands of the stomach to secrete an acid, but not pepsin. Now, I have every reason to believe (though the fact is not fully established), that although the glands of Drosera are continually secreting viscid fluid to replace that lost by evaporation, yet they do not secrete the ferment proper for digestion when mechanically irritated, but only after absorbing certain matter, probably of a nitrogenous nature. I infer that this is the case, as the secretion from a large number of leaves which had been irritated by particles of glass placed on their discs did not digest albumen; and more especially from the analogy of Dionaea and Nepenthes. In like manner, the glands of the stomach of animals secrete pepsin, as Schiff asserts, only after they have absorbed certain soluble substances, which he designates as peptogenes. There is, therefore, a remarkable parallelism between the glands of Drosera and those of the stomach in the secretion of their proper acid and ferment. The secretion, as we have seen, completely dissolves albumen, muscle, fibrin, areolar tissue, cartilage, the fibrous basis of bone, gelatine, chondrin, casein in the state in which it exists in milk, and gluten which has been subjected to weak hydrochloric acid. Syntonin and legumin excite the leaves so powerfully and quickly that there can hardly be a doubt that both would be dissolved by the secretion. The secretion * ‘Phys. de la Digestion,’ 1867, tom. ii. pp. 188, 245. [page 130] failed to digest fresh gluten, apparently from its injuring the glands, though some was absorbed. Raw meat, unless in very small bits, and large pieces of albumen, &c., likewise injure the leaves, which seem to suffer, like animals, from a surfeit. I know not whether the analogy is a real one, but it is worth notice that a decoction of cabbage leaves is far more exciting and probably nutritious to Drosera than an infusion made with tepid water; and boiled cabbages are far more nutritious, at least to man, than the uncooked leaves. The most striking of all the cases, though not really more remarkable than many others, is the digestion of so hard and tough a substance as cartilage. The dissolution of pure phosphate of lime, of bone, dentine, and especially enamel, seems wonderful; but it depends merely on the long-continued secretion of an acid; and this is secreted for a longer time under these circumstances than under any others. It was interesting to observe that as long as the acid was consumed in dissolving the phosphate of lime, no true digestion occurred; but that as soon as the bone was completely decalcified, the fibrous basis was attacked and liquefied with the greatest ease. The twelve substances above enumerated, which are completely dissolved by the secretion, are likewise dissolved by the gastric juice of the higher animals; and they are acted on in the same manner, as shown by the rounding of the angles of albumen, and more especially by the manner in which the transverse striae of the fibres of muscle disappear. The secretion of Drosera and gastric juice were both able to dissolve some element or impurity out of the globulin and haematin employed by me. The secretion also dissolved something out of chemically [page 131] prepared casein, which is said to consist of two substances; and although Schiff asserts that casein in this state is not attacked by gastric juice, he might easily have overlooked a minute quantity of some albuminous matter, which Drosera would detect and absorb. Again, fibro-cartilage, though not properly dissolved, is acted on in the same manner, both by the secretion of Drosera and gastric juice. But this substance, as well as the so-called haematin used by me, ought perhaps to have been classed with indigestible substances. That gastric juice acts by means of its ferment, pepsin, solely in the presence of an acid, is well established; and we have excellent evidence that a ferment is present in the secretion of Drosera, which likewise acts only in the presence of an acid; for we have seen that when the secretion is neutralised by minute drops of the solution of an alkali, the digestion of albumen is completely stopped, and that on the addition of a minute dose of hydrochloric acid it immediately recommences. The nine following substances, or classes of substances, namely, epidermic productions, fibro-elastic tissue, mucin, pepsin, urea, chitine, cellulose, gun-cotton, chlorophyll, starch, fat and oil, are not acted on by the secretion of Drosera; nor are they, as far as is known, by the gastric juice of animals. Some soluble matter, however, was extracted from the mucin, pepsin, and chlorophyll, used by me, both by the secretion and by artificial gastric juice. The several substances, which are completely dissolved by the secretion, and which are afterwards absorbed by the glands, affect the leaves rather differently. They induce inflection at very different [page 132] rates and in very different degrees; and the tentacles remain inflected for very different periods of time. Quick inflection depends partly on the quantity of the substance given, so that many glands are simultaneously affected, partly on the facility with which it is penetrated and liquefied by the secretion, partly on its nature, but chiefly on the presence of exciting matter already in solution. Thus saliva, or a weak solution of raw meat, acts much more quickly than even a strong solution of gelatine. So again leaves which have re-expanded, after absorbing drops of a solution of pure gelatine or isinglass (the latter being the more powerful of the two), if given bits of meat, are inflected much more energetically and quickly than they were before, notwithstanding that some rest is generally requisite between two acts of inflection. We probably see the influence of texture in gelatine and globulin when softened by having been soaked in water acting more quickly than when merely wetted. It may be partly due to changed texture, and partly to changed chemical nature, that albumen, which had been kept for some time, and gluten which had been subjected to weak hydrochloric acid, act more quickly than these substances in their fresh state. The length of time during which the tentacles remain inflected largely depends on the quantity of the substance given, partly on the facility with which it is penetrated or acted on by the secretion, and partly on its essential nature. The tentacles always remain inflected much longer over large bits or large drops than over small bits or drops. Texture probably plays a part in determining the extraordinary length of time during which the tentacles remain inflected [page 133] over the hard grains of chemically prepared casein. But the tentacles remain inflected for an equally long time over finely powdered, precipitated phosphate of lime; phosphorus in this latter case evidently being the attraction, and animal matter in the case of casein. The leaves remain long inflected over insects, but it is doubtful how far this is due to the protection afforded by their chitinous integuments; for animal matter is soon extracted from insects (probably by exosmose from their bodies into the dense surrounding secretion), as shown by the prompt inflection of the leaves. We see the influence of the nature of different substances in bits of meat, albumen, and fresh gluten acting very differently from equal-sized bits of gelatine, areolar tissue, and the fibrous basis of bone. The former cause not only far more prompt and energetic, but more prolonged, inflection than do the latter. Hence we are, I think, justified in believing that gelatine, areolar tissue, and the fibrous basis of bone, would be far less nutritious to Drosera than such substances as insects, meat, albumen, &c. This is an interesting conclusion, as it is known that gelatine affords but little nutriment to animals; and so, probably, would areolar tissue and the fibrous basis of bone. The chondrin which I used acted more powerfully than gelatine, but then I do not know that it was pure. It is a more remarkable fact that fibrin, which belongs to the great class of Proteids,* including albumen in one of its sub-groups, does not excite the tentacles in a greater degree, or keep them inflected for a longer time, than does gelatine, or * See the classification adopted by Dr. Michael Foster in Watts’ ‘Dictionary of Chemistry,’ Supplement 1872, page 969. [page 134] areolar tissue, or the fibrous basis of bone. It is not known how long an animal would survive if fed on fibrin alone, but Dr. Sanderson has no doubt longer than on gelatine, and it would be hardly rash to predict, judging from the effects on Drosera, that albumen would be found more nutritious than fibrin. Globulin likewise belongs to the Proteids, forming another sub-group, and this substance, though containing some matter which excited Drosera rather strongly, was hardly attacked by the secretion, and was very little or very slowly attacked by gastric juice. How far globulin would be nutritious to animals is not known. We thus see how differently the above specified several digestible substances act on Drosera; and we may infer, as highly probable, that they would in like manner be nutritious in very different degrees both to Drosera and to animals. The glands of Drosera absorb matter from living seeds, which are injured or killed by the secretion. They likewise absorb matter from pollen, and from fresh leaves; and this is notoriously the case with the stomachs of vegetable-feeding animals. Drosera is properly an insectivorous plant; but as pollen cannot fail to be often blown on to the glands, as will occasionally the seeds and leaves of surrounding plants, Drosera is, to a certain extent, a vegetable-feeder. Finally, the experiments recorded in this chapter show us that there is a remarkable accordance in the power of digestion between the gastric juice of animals with its pepsin and hydrochloric acid and the secretion of Drosera with its ferment and acid belonging to the acetic series. We can, therefore, hardly doubt that the ferment in both cases is closely similar, [page 135] if not identically the same. That a plant and an animal should pour forth the same, or nearly the same, complex secretion, adapted for the same purpose of digestion, is a new and wonderful fact in physiology. But I shall have to recur to this subject in the fifteenth chapter, in my concluding remarks on the Droseraceae. [page 136] ',\n",
              " 'VII. THE EFFECTS OF SALTS OF AMMONIA. Manner of performing the experiments—Action of distilled water in comparison with the solutions—Carbonate of ammonia, absorbed by the roots—The vapour absorbed by the glands—Drops on the disc—Minute drops applied to separate glands—Leaves immersed in weak solutions—Minuteness of the doses which induce aggregation of the protoplasm—Nitrate of ammonia, analogous experiments with—Phosphate of ammonia, analogous experiments with—Other salts of ammonia—Summary and concluding remarks on the action of salts of ammonia. The chief object in this chapter is to show how powerfully the salts of ammonia act on the leaves of Drosera, and more especially to show what an extraordinarily small quantity suffices to excite inflection. I shall, therefore, be compelled to enter into full details. Doubly distilled water was always used; and for the more delicate experiments, water which had been prepared with the utmost possible care was given me by Professor Frankland. The graduated measures were tested, and found as accurate as such measures can be. The salts were carefully weighed, and in all the more delicate experiments, by Borda’s double method. But extreme accuracy would have been superfluous, as the leaves differ greatly in irritability, according to age, condition, and constitution. Even the tentacles on the same leaf differ in irritability to a marked degree. My experiments were tried in the following several ways. [Firstly.—Drops which were ascertained by repeated trials to be on an average about half a minim, or the 1/960 of a fluid ounce (.0296 ml.), were placed by the same pointed instrument on the [page 137] discs of the leaves, and the inflection of the exterior rows of tentacles observed at successive intervals of time. It was first ascertained, from between thirty and forty trials, that distilled water dropped in this manner produces no effect, except that sometimes, though rarely, two or three tentacles become inflected. In fact all the many trials with solutions which were so weak as to produce no effect lead to the same result that water is inefficient. Secondly.—The head of a small pin, fixed into a handle, was dipped into the solution under trial. The small drop which adhered to it, and which was much too small to fall off, was cautiously placed, by the aid of a lens, in contact with the secretion surrounding the glands of one, two, three, or four of the exterior tentacles of the same leaf. Great care was taken that the glands themselves should not be touched. I had supposed that the drops were of nearly the same size; but on trial this proved a great mistake. I first measured some water, and removed 300 drops, touching the pin’s head each time on blotting-paper; and on again measuring the water, a drop was found to equal on an average about the 1/60 of a minim. Some water in a small vessel was weighed (and this is a more accurate method), and 300 drops removed as before; and on again weighing the water, a drop was found to equal on an average only the 1/89 of a minim. I repeated the operation, but endeavoured this time, by taking the pin’s head out of the water obliquely and rather quickly, to remove as large drops as possible; and the result showed that I had succeeded, for each drop on an average equalled 1/19.4 of a minim. I repeated the operation in exactly the same manner, and now the drops averaged 1/23.5 of a minim. Bearing in mind that on these two latter occasions special pains were taken to remove as large drops as possible, we may safely conclude that the drops used in my experiments were at least equal to the 1/20 of a minim, or .0029 ml. One of these drops could be applied to three or even four glands, and if the tentacles became inflected, some of the solution must have been absorbed by all; for drops of pure water, applied in the same manner, never produced any effect. I was able to hold the drop in steady contact with the secretion only for ten to fifteen seconds; and this was not time enough for the diffusion of all the salt in solution, as was evident, from three or four tentacles treated successively with the same drop, often becoming inflected. All the matter in solution was even then probably not exhausted. Thirdly.—Leaves cut off and immersed in a measured [page 138] quantity of the solution under trial; the same number of leaves being immersed at the same time, in the same quantity of the distilled water which had been used in making the solution. The leaves in the two lots were compared at short intervals of time, up to 24 hrs., and sometimes to 48 hrs. They were immersed by being laid as gently as possible in numbered watch-glasses, and thirty minims (1.775 ml.) of the solution or of water was poured over each. Some solutions, for instance that of carbonate of ammonia, quickly discolour the glands; and as all on the same leaf were discoloured simultaneously, they must all have absorbed some of the salt within the same short period of time. This was likewise shown by the simultaneous inflection of the several exterior rows of tentacles. If we had no such evidence as this, it might have been supposed that only the glands of the exterior and inflected tentacles had absorbed the salt; or that only those on the disc had absorbed it, and had then transmitted a motor impulse to the exterior tentacles; but in this latter case the exterior tentacles would not have become inflected until some time had elapsed, instead of within half an hour, or even within a few minutes, as usually occurred. All the glands on the same leaf are of nearly the same size, as may best be seen by cutting off a narrow transverse strip, and laying it on its side; hence their absorbing surfaces are nearly equal. The long-headed glands on the extreme margin must be excepted, as they are much longer than the others; but only the upper surface is capable of absorption. Besides the glands, both surfaces of the leaves and the pedicels of the tentacles bear numerous minute papillae, which absorb carbonate of ammonia, an infusion of raw meat, metallic salts, and probably many other substances, but the absorption of matter by these papillae never induces inflection. We must remember that the movement of each separate tentacle depends on its gland being excited, except when a motor impulse is transmitted from the glands of the disc, and then the movement, as just stated, does not take place until some little time has elapsed. I have made these remarks because they show us that when a leaf is immersed in a solution, and the tentacles are inflected, we can judge with some accuracy how much of the salt each gland has absorbed. For instance, if a leaf bearing 212 glands be immersed in a measured quantity of a solution, containing 1/10 of a grain of a salt, and all the exterior tentacles, except twelve, are inflected, we may feel sure that each of the 200 glands can on an average have absorbed at most 1/2000 of a grain of the salt. I say at [page 139] most, for the papillae will have absorbed some small amount, and so will perhaps the glands of the twelve excluded tentacles which did not become inflected. The application of this principle leads to remarkable conclusions with respect to the minuteness of the doses causing inflection. _On the Action of Distilled Water in Causing Inflection._ Although in all the more important experiments the difference between the leaves simultaneously immersed in water and in the several solutions will be described, nevertheless it may be well here to give a summary of the effects of water. The fact, moreover, of pure water acting on the glands deserves in itself some notice. Leaves to the number of 141 were immersed in water at the same time with those in the solutions, and their state recorded at short intervals of time. Thirty-two other leaves were separately observed in water, making altogether 173 experiments. Many scores of leaves were also immersed in water at other times, but no exact record of the effects produced was kept; yet these cursory observations support the conclusions arrived at in this chapter. A few of the long-headed tentacles, namely from one to about six, were commonly inflected within half an hour after immersion; as were occasionally a few, and rarely a considerable number of the exterior round-headed tentacles. After an immersion of from 5 to 8 hrs. the short tentacles surrounding the outer parts of the disc generally become inflected, so that their glands form a small dark ring on the disc; the exterior tentacles not partaking of this movement. Hence, excepting in a few cases hereafter to be specified, we can judge whether a solution produces any effect only by observing the exterior tentacles within the first 3 or 4 hrs. after immersion. Now for a summary of the state of the 173 leaves after an immersion of 3 or 4 hrs. in pure water. One leaf had almost all its tentacles inflected; three leaves had most of them sub-inflected; and thirteen had on an average 36.5 tentacles inflected. Thus seventeen leaves out of the 173 were acted on in a marked manner. Eighteen leaves had from seven to nineteen tentacles inflected, the average being 9.3 tentacles for each leaf. Forty-four leaves had from one to six tentacles inflected, generally the long-headed ones. So that altogether of the 173 leaves carefully observed, seventy-nine were affected by the water in some degree, though commonly to a very slight degree; and ninety-four were not affected in the least degree. This [page 140] amount of inflection is utterly insignificant, as we shall hereafter see, compared with that caused by very weak solutions of several salts of ammonia. Plants which have lived for some time in a rather high temperature are far more sensitive to the action of water than those grown out of doors, or recently brought into a warm greenhouse. Thus in the above seventeen cases, in which the immersed leaves had a considerable number of tentacles inflected, the plants had been kept during the winter in a very warm greenhouse; and they bore in the early spring remarkably fine leaves, of a light red colour. Had I then known that the sensitiveness of plants was thus increased, perhaps I should not have used the leaves for my experiments with the very weak solutions of phosphate of ammonia; but my experiments are not thus vitiated, as I invariably used leaves from the same plants for simultaneous immersion in water. It often happened that some leaves on the same plant, and some tentacles on the same leaf, were more sensitive than others; but why this should be so, I do not know. FIG. 9. (Drosera rotundifolia.) Leaf (enlarged) with all the tentacles closely inflected, from immersion in a solution of phosphate of ammonia (one part to 87,500 of water.) Besides the differences just indicated between the leaves immersed in water and in weak solutions of ammonia, the tentacles of the latter are in most cases much more closely inflected. The appearance of a leaf after immersion in a few drops of a solution of 1 grain of phosphate of ammonia to 200 oz. of water (i.e. one part to 87,500) is here reproduced: such energetic inflection is never caused by water alone. With leaves in the weak solutions, the blade or lamina often becomes inflected; and this is so rare a circumstance with leaves in water that I have seen only two instances; and in both of these the inflection was very feeble. Again, with leaves in the weak solutions, the inflection of the tentacles and blade often goes on steadily, though slowly, increasing during many hours; and [page 141] this again is so rare a circumstance with leaves in water that I have seen only three instances of any such increase after the first 8 to 12 hrs.; and in these three instances the two outer rows of tentacles were not at all affected. Hence there is sometimes a much greater difference between the leaves in water and in the weak solutions, after from 8 hrs. to 24 hrs., than there was within the first 3 hrs.; though as a general rule it is best to trust to the difference observed within the shorter time. With respect to the period of the re-expansion of the leaves, when left immersed either in water or in the weak solutions, nothing could be more variable. In both cases the exterior tentacles not rarely begin to re-expand, after an interval of only from 6 to 8 hrs.; that is just about the time when the short tentacles round the borders of the disc become inflected. On the other hand, the tentacles sometimes remain inflected for a whole day, or even two days; but as a general rule they remain inflected for a longer period in very weak solutions than in water. In solutions which are not extremely weak, they never re-expand within nearly so short a period as six or eight hours. From these statements it might be thought difficult to distinguish between the effects of water and the weaker solutions; but in truth there is not the slightest difficulty until excessively weak solutions are tried; and then the distinction, as might be expected, becomes very doubtful, and at last disappears. But as in all, except the simplest, cases the state of the leaves simultaneously immersed for an equal length of time in water and in the solutions will be described, the reader can judge for himself.] CARBONATE OF AMMONIA. This salt, when absorbed by the roots, does not cause the tentacles to be inflected. A plant was so placed in a solution of one part of the carbonate to 146 of water that the young uninjured roots could be observed. The terminal cells, which were of a pink colour, instantly became colourless, and their limpid contents cloudy, like a mezzo-tinto engraving, so that some degree of aggregation was almost instantly caused; but no further change ensued, and the absorbent hairs were not visibly affected. The tentacles [page 142] did not bend. Two other plants were placed with their roots surrounded by damp moss, in half an ounce (14.198 ml.) of a solution of one part of the carbonate to 218 of water, and were observed for 24 hrs.; but not a single tentacle was inflected. In order to produce this effect, the carbonate must be absorbed by the glands. The vapour produces a powerful effect on the glands, and induces inflection. Three plants with their roots in bottles, so that the surrounding air could not have become very humid, were placed under a bell-glass (holding 122 fluid ounces), together with 4 grains of carbonate of ammonia in a watch-glass. After an interval of 6 hrs. 15 m. the leaves appeared unaffected; but next morning, after 20 hrs., the blackened glands were secreting copiously, and most of the tentacles were strongly inflected. These plants soon died. Two other plants were placed under the same bell-glass, together with half a grain of the carbonate, the air being rendered as damp as possible; and in 2 hrs. most of the leaves were affected, many of the glands being blackened and the tentacles inflected. But it is a curious fact that some of the closely adjoining tentacles on the same leaf, both on the disc and round the margins, were much, and some, apparently, not in the least affected. The plants were kept under the bell-glass for 24 hrs., but no further change ensued. One healthy leaf was hardly at all affected, though other leaves on the same plant were much affected. On some leaves all the tentacles on one side, but not those on the opposite side, were inflected. I doubt whether this extremely unequal action can be explained by supposing that the more active glands absorb all the vapour as quickly as it is generated, so that none is left for the others, for we shall meet with [page 143] analogous cases with air thoroughly permeated with the vapours of chloroform and ether. Minute particles of the carbonate were added to the secretion surrounding several glands. These instantly became black and secreted copiously; but, except in two instances, when extremely minute particles were given, there was no inflection. This result is analogous to that which follows from the immersion of leaves in a strong solution of one part of the carbonate to 109, or 146, or even 218 of water, for the leaves are then paralysed and no inflection ensues, though the glands are blackened, and the protoplasm in the cells of the tentacles undergoes strong aggregation. [We will now turn to the effects of solutions of the carbonate. Half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water were placed on the discs of twelve leaves; so that each received 1/960 of a grain or .0675 mg. Ten of these had their tentacles well inflected; the blades of some being also much curved inwards. In two cases several of the exterior tentacles were inflected in 35 m.; but the movement was generally slower. These ten leaves re-expanded in periods varying between 21 hrs. and 45 hrs., but in one case not until 67 hrs. had elapsed; so that they re-expanded much more quickly than leaves which have caught insects. The same-sized drops of a solution of one part to 875 of water were placed on the discs of eleven leaves; six remained quite unaffected, whilst five had from three to six or eight of their exterior tentacles inflected; but this degree of movement can hardly be considered as trustworthy. Each of these leaves received 1/1920 of a grain (.0337 mg.), distributed between the glands of the disc, but this was too small an amount to produce any decided effect on the exterior tentacles, the glands of which had not themselves received any of the salt. Minute drops on the head of a small pin, of a solution of one part of the carbonate to 218 of water, were next tried in the manner above described. A drop of this kind equals on an average 1/20 of a minim, and therefore contains 1/4800 of a grain (.0135 mg.) of the carbonate. I touched with it the viscid secretion round three glands, so that each gland received only [page 144] 1/14400 of a grain (.00445 mg.). Nevertheless, in two trials all the glands were plainly blackened; in one case all three tentacles were well inflected after an interval of 2 hrs. 40 m.; and in another case two of the three tentacles were inflected. I then tried drops of a weaker solution of one part to 292 of water on twenty-four glands, always touching the viscid secretion round three glands with the same little drop. Each gland thus received only the 1/19200 of a grain (.00337 mg.), yet some of them were a little darkened; but in no one instance were any of the tentacles inflected, though they were watched for 12 hrs. When a still weaker solution (viz. one part to 437 of water) was tried on six glands, no effect whatever was perceptible. We thus learn that the 1/14400 of a grain (.00445 mg.) of carbonate of ammonia, if absorbed by a gland, suffices to induce inflection in the basal part of the same tentacle; but as already stated, I was able to hold with a steady hand the minute drops in contact with the secretion only for a few seconds; and if more time had been allowed for diffusion and absorption, a much weaker solution would certainly have acted. Some experiments were made by immersing cut-off leaves in solutions of different strengths. Thus four leaves were left for about 3 hrs. each in a drachm (3.549 ml.) of a solution of one part of the carbonate to 5250 of water; two of these had almost every tentacle inflected, the third had about half the tentacles and the fourth about one-third inflected; and all the glands were blackened. Another leaf was placed in the same quantity of a solution of one part to 7000 of water, and in 1 hr. 16 m. every single tentacle was well inflected, and all the glands blackened. Six leaves were immersed, each in thirty minims (1.774 ml.) of a solution of one part to 4375 of water, and the glands were all blackened in 31 m. All six leaves exhibited some slight inflection, and one was strongly inflected. Four leaves were then immersed in thirty minims of a solution of one part to 8750 of water, so that each leaf received the 1/320 of a grain (.2025 mg.). Only one became strongly inflected; but all the glands on all the leaves were of so dark a red after one hour as almost to deserve to be called black, whereas this did not occur with the leaves which were at the same time immersed in water; nor did water produce this effect on any other occasion in nearly so short a time as an hour. These cases of the simultaneous darkening or blackening of the glands from the action of weak solutions are important, as they show that all the glands absorbed the carbonate within the same time, which fact indeed there was not the least reason to doubt. So again, whenever all the [page 145] tentacles become inflected within the same time, we have evidence, as before remarked, of simultaneous absorption. I did not count the number of glands on these four leaves; but as they were fine ones, and as we know that the average number of glands on thirty-one leaves was 192, we may safely assume that each bore on an average at least 170; and if so, each blackened gland could have absorbed only 1/54400 of a grain (.00119 mg.) of the carbonate. A large number of trials had been previously made with solutions of one part of the nitrate and phosphate of ammonia to 43750 of water (i.e. one grain to 100 ounces), and these were found highly efficient. Fourteen leaves were therefore placed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part of the carbonate to the above quantity of water; so that each leaf received 1/1600 of a grain (.0405 mg.). The glands were not much darkened. Ten of the leaves were not affected, or only very slightly so. Four, however, were strongly affected; the first having all the tentacles, except forty, inflected in 47 m.; in 6 hrs. 30 m. all except eight; and after 4 hrs. the blade itself. The second leaf after 9 m. had all its tentacles except nine inflected; after 6 hrs. 30 m. these nine were sub-inflected; the blade having become much inflected in 4 hrs. The third leaf after 1 hr. 6 m. had all but forty tentacles inflected. The fourth, after 2 hrs. 5 m., had about half its tentacles and after 4 hrs. all but forty-five inflected. Leaves which were immersed in water at the same time were not at all affected, with the exception of one; and this not until 8 hrs. had elapsed. Hence there can be no doubt that a highly sensitive leaf, if immersed in a solution, so that all the glands are enabled to absorb, is acted on by 1/1600 of a grain of the carbonate. Assuming that the leaf, which was a large one, and which had all its tentacles excepting eight inflected, bore 170 glands, each gland could have absorbed only 1/268800 of a grain (.00024 mg.); yet this sufficed to act on each of the 162 tentacles which were inflected. But as only four out of the above fourteen leaves were plainly affected, this is nearly the minimum dose which is efficient. Aggregation of the Protoplasm from the Action of Carbonate of Ammonia.—I have fully described in the third chapter the remarkable effects of moderately strong doses of this salt in causing the aggregation of the protoplasm within the cells of the glands and tentacles; and here my object is merely to show what small doses suffice. A leaf was immersed in twenty minims (1.183 ml.) of a solution of one part to 1750 of water, [page 146] and another leaf in the same quantity of a solution of one part to 3062; in the former case aggregation occurred in 4 m., in the latter in 11 m. A leaf was then immersed in twenty minims of a solution of one part to 4375 of water, so that it received 1/240 of a grain (.27 mg.); in 5 m. there was a slight change of colour in the glands, and in 15 m. small spheres of protoplasm were formed in the cells beneath the glands of all the tentacles. In these cases there could not be a shadow of a doubt about the action of the solution. A solution was then made of one part to 5250 of water, and I experimented on fourteen leaves, but will give only a few of the cases. Eight young leaves were selected and examined with care, and they showed no trace of aggregation. Four of these were placed in a drachm (3.549 ml.) of distilled water; and four in a similar vessel, with a drachm of the solution. After a time the leaves were examined under a high power, being taken alternately from the solution and the water. The first leaf was taken out of the solution after an immersion of 2 hrs. 40 m., and the last leaf out of the water after 3 hrs. 50 m.; the examination lasting for 1 hr. 40 m. In the four leaves out of the water there was no trace of aggregation except in one specimen, in which a very few, extremely minute spheres of protoplasm were present beneath some of the round glands. All the glands were translucent and red. The four leaves which had been immersed in the solution, besides being inflected, presented a widely different appearance; for the contents of the cells of every single tentacle on all four leaves were conspicuously aggregated; the spheres and elongated masses of protoplasm in many cases extending halfway down the tentacles. All the glands, both those of the central and exterior tentacles, were opaque and blackened; and this shows that all had absorbed some of the carbonate. These four leaves were of very nearly the same size, and the glands were counted on one and found to be 167. This being the case, and the four leaves having been immersed in a drachm of the solution, each gland could have received on an average only 1/64128 of a grain (.001009 mg.) of the salt; and this quantity sufficed to induce within a short time conspicuous aggregation in the cells beneath all the glands. A vigorous but rather small red leaf was placed in six minims of the same solution (viz. one part to 5250 of water), so that it received 1/960 of a grain (.0675 mg.). In 40 m. the glands appeared rather darker; and in 1 hr. from four to six spheres of protoplasm were formed in the cells beneath the glands of all the tentacles. I did not count the tentacles, but we may [page 147] safely assume that there were at least 140; and if so, each gland could have received only the 1/134400 of a grain, or .00048 mg. A weaker solution was then made of one part to 7000 of water, and four leaves were immersed in it; but I will give only one case. A leaf was placed in ten minims of this solution; after 1 hr. 37 m. the glands became somewhat darker, and the cells beneath all of them now contained many spheres of aggregated protoplasm. This leaf received 1/768 of a grain, and bore 166 glands. Each gland could, therefore, have received only 1/127488 of a grain (.00507 mg.) of the carbonate. Two other experiments are worth giving. A leaf was immersed for 4 hrs. 15 m. in distilled water, and there was no aggregation; it was then placed for 1 hr. 15 m. in a little solution of one part to 5250 of water; and this excited well-marked aggregation and inflection. Another leaf, after having been immersed for 21 hrs. 15 m. in distilled water, had its glands blackened, but there was no aggregation in the cells beneath them; it was then left in six minims of the same solution, and in 1 hr. there was much aggregation in many of the tentacles; in 2 hrs. all the tentacles (146 in number) were affected—the aggregation extending down for a length equal to half or the whole of the glands. It is extremely improbable that these two leaves would have undergone aggregation if they had been left for a little longer in the water, namely for 1 hr. and 1 hr. 15 m., during which time they were immersed in the solution; for the process of aggregation seems invariably to supervene slowly and very gradually in water.] A Summary of the Results with Carbonate of Ammonia.—The roots absorb the solution, as shown by their changed colour, and by the aggregation of the contents of their cells. The vapour is absorbed by the glands; these are blackened, and the tentacles are inflected. The glands of the disc, when excited by a half-minim drop (.0296 ml.), containing 1/960 of a grain (.0675 mg.), transmit a motor impulse to the exterior tentacles, causing them to bend inwards. A minute drop, containing 1/14400 of a grain (.00445 mg.), if held for a few seconds in contact with a gland, soon causes the tentacle bearing it to be inflected. If a leaf is left [page 148] immersed for a few hours in a solution, and a gland absorbs the 1/134400 of a grain (.0048 mg.), its colour becomes darker, though not actually black; and the contents of the cells beneath the gland are plainly aggregated. Lastly, under the same circumstances, the absorption by a gland of the 1/268800 of a grain (.00024 mg.) suffices to excite the tentacle bearing this gland into movement. NITRATE OF AMMONIA. With the salt I attended only to the inflection of the leaves, for it is far less efficient than the carbonate in causing aggregation, although considerably more potent in causing inflection. I experimented with half-minims (.0296 ml.) on the discs of fifty-two leaves, but will give only a few cases. A solution of one part to 109 of water was too strong, causing little inflection, and after 24 hrs. killing, or nearly killing, four out of six leaves which were thus tried; each of which received the 1/240 of a grain (or .27 mg.). A solution of one part to 218 of water acted most energetically, causing not only the tentacles of all the leaves, but the blades of some, to be strongly inflected. Fourteen leaves were tried with drops of a solution of one part to 875 of water, so that the disc of each received the 1/1920 of a grain (.0337 mg.). Of these leaves, seven were very strongly acted on, the edges being generally inflected; two were moderately acted on; and five not at all. I subsequently tried three of these latter five leaves with urine, saliva, and mucus, but they were only slightly affected; and this proves that they were not in an active condition. I mention this fact to show how necessary it is to experiment on several leaves. Two of the leaves, which were well inflected, re-expanded after 51 hrs. In the following experiment I happened to select very sensitive leaves. Half-minims of a solution of one part to 1094 of water (i.e. 1 gr. to 2 1/2 oz.) were placed on the discs of nine leaves, so that each received the 1/2400 of a grain (.027 mg.). Three of them had their tentacles strongly inflected and their blades curled inwards; five were slightly and somewhat doubtfully affected, having from three to eight of their exterior tentacles inflected: one leaf was not at all affected, yet was afterwards acted on by saliva. In six of these cases, a trace of action was perceptible in [page 149] 7 hrs., but the full effect was not produced until from 24 hrs. to 30 hrs. had elapsed. Two of the leaves, which were only slightly inflected, re-expanded after an additional interval of 19 hrs. Half-minims of a rather weaker solution, viz. of one part to 1312 of water (1 gr. to 3 oz.) were tried on fourteen leaves; so that each received 1/2880 of a grain (.0225 mg.), instead of, as in the last experiment, 1/2400 of a grain. The blade of one was plainly inflected, as were six of the exterior tentacles; the blade of a second was slightly, and two of the exterior tentacles well, inflected, all the other tentacles being curled in at right angles to the disc; three other leaves had from five to eight tentacles inflected; five others only two or three, and occasionally, though very rarely, drops of pure water cause this much action; the four remaining leaves were in no way affected, yet three of them, when subsequently tried with urine, became greatly inflected. In most of these cases a slight effect was perceptible in from 6 hrs. to 7 hrs., but the full effect was not produced until from 24 hrs. to 30 hrs. had elapsed. It is obvious that we have here reached very nearly the minimum amount, which, distributed between the glands of the disc, acts on the exterior tentacles; these having themselves not received any of the solution. In the next place, the viscid secretion round three of the exterior glands was touched with the same little drop (1/20 of a minim) of a solution of one part to 437 of water; and after an interval of 2 hrs. 50 m. all three tentacles were well inflected. Each of these glands could have received only the 1/28800 of a grain, or .00225 mg. A little drop of the same size and strength was also applied to four other glands, and in 1 hr. two became inflected, whilst the other two never moved. We here see, as in the case of the half-minims placed on the discs, that the nitrate of ammonia is more potent in causing inflection than the carbonate; for minute drops of the latter salt of this strength produced no effect. I tried minute drops of a still weaker solution of the nitrate, viz. one part to 875 of water, on twenty-one glands, but no effect whatever was produced, except perhaps in one instance. Sixty-three leaves were immersed in solutions of various strengths; other leaves being immersed at the same time in the same pure water used in making the solutions. The results are so remarkable, though less so than with phosphate of ammonia, that I must describe the experiments in detail, but I will give only a few. In speaking of the successive periods when inflection occurred, I always reckon from the time of first immersion. [page 150] Having made some preliminary trials as a guide, five leaves were placed in the same little vessel in thirty minims of a solution of one part of the nitrate to 7875 of water (1 gr. to 18 oz.); and this amount of fluid just sufficed to cover them. After 2 hrs. 10 m. three of the leaves were considerably inflected, and the other two moderately. The glands of all became of so dark a red as almost to deserve to be called black. After 8 hrs. four of the leaves had all their tentacles more or less inflected; whilst the fifth, which I then perceived to be an old leaf, had only thirty tentacles inflected. Next morning, after 23 hrs. 40 m., all the leaves were in the same state, excepting that the old leaf had a few more tentacles inflected. Five leaves which had been placed at the same time in water were observed at the same intervals of time; after 2 hrs. 10 m. two of them had four, one had seven, one had ten, of the long-headed marginal tentacles, and the fifth had four round-headed tentacles, inflected. After 8 hrs. there was no change in these leaves, and after 24 hrs. all the marginal tentacles had re-expanded; but in one leaf, a dozen, and in a second leaf, half a dozen, submarginal tentacles had become inflected. As the glands of the five leaves in the solution were simultaneously darkened, no doubt they had all absorbed a nearly equal amount of the salt: and as 1/288 of a grain was given to the five leaves together, each got 1/1440 of a grain (.045 mg.). I did not count the tentacles on these leaves, which were moderately fine ones, but as the average number on thirty-one leaves was 192, it would be safe to assume that each bore on an average at least 160. If so, each of the darkened glands could have received only 1/230400 of a grain of the nitrate; and this caused the inflection of a great majority of the tentacles. This plan of immersing several leaves in the same vessel is a bad one, as it is impossible to feel sure that the more vigorous leaves do not rob the weaker ones of their share of the salt. The glands, moreover, must often touch one another or the sides of the vessel, and movement may have been thus excited; but the corresponding leaves in water, which were little inflected, though rather more so than commonly occurs, were exposed in an almost equal degree to these same sources of error. I will, therefore, give only one other experiment made in this manner, though many were tried and all confirmed the foregoing and following results. Four leaves were placed in forty minims of a solution of one part to 10,500 of water; and assuming that they absorbed equally, each leaf received 1/1152 of a grain (.0562 mg.). After 1 hr. 20 m. many of the tentacles on all four leaves were somewhat inflected. After [page 151] 5 hrs. 30 m. two leaves had all their tentacles inflected; a third leaf all except the extreme marginals, which seemed old and torpid; and the fourth a large number. After 21 hrs. every single tentacle, on all four leaves, was closely inflected. Of the four leaves placed at the same time in water, one had, after 5 hrs. 45 m., five marginal tentacles inflected; a second, ten; a third, nine marginals and submarginals; and the fourth, twelve, chiefly submarginals, inflected. After 21 hrs. all these marginal tentacles re-expanded, but a few of the submarginals on two of the leaves remained slightly curved inwards. The contrast was wonderfully great between these four leaves in water and those in the solution, the latter having every one of their tentacles closely inflected. Making the moderate assumption that each of these leaves bore 160 tentacles, each gland could have absorbed only 1/184320 of a grain (.000351 mg.). This experiment was repeated on three leaves with the same relative amount of the solution; and after 6 hrs. 15 m. all the tentacles except nine, on all three leaves taken together, were closely inflected. In this case the tentacles on each leaf were counted, and gave an average of 162 per leaf. The following experiments were tried during the summer of 1873, by placing the leaves, each in a separate watch-glass and pouring over it thirty minims (1.775 ml.) of the solution; other leaves being treated in exactly the same manner with the doubly distilled water used in making the solutions. The trials above given were made several years before, and when I read over my notes, I could not believe in the results; so I resolved to begin again with moderately strong solutions. Six leaves were first immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part of the nitrate to 8750 of water (1 gr. to 20 oz.), so that each received 1/320 of a grain (.2025 mg.). Before 30 m. had elapsed, four of these leaves were immensely, and two of them moderately, inflected. The glands were rendered of a dark red. The four corresponding leaves in water were not at all affected until 6 hrs. had elapsed, and then only the short tentacles on the borders of the disc; and their inflection, as previously explained, is never of any significance. Four leaves were immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part to 17,500 of water (1 gr. to 40 oz.), so that each received 1/640 of a grain (.101 mg.); and in less than 45 m. three of them had all their tentacles, except from four to ten, inflected; the blade of one being inflected after 6 hrs., and the blade of a second after 21 hrs. The fourth leaf was not at all affected. The glands of none were darkened. Of the corresponding leaves [page 152] in water, only one had any of its exterior tentacles, namely five, inflected; after 6 hrs. in one case, and after 21 hrs. in two other cases, the short tentacles on the borders of the disc formed a ring, in the usual manner. Four leaves were immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part to 43,750 of water (1 gr. to 100 oz.), so that each leaf got 1/1600 of a grain (.0405 mg.). Of these, one was much inflected in 8 m., and after 2 hrs. 7 m. had all the tentacles, except thirteen, inflected. The second leaf, after 10 m., had all except three inflected. The third and fourth were hardly at all affected, scarcely more than the corresponding leaves in water. Of the latter, only one was affected, this having two tentacles inflected, with those on the outer parts of the disc forming a ring in the usual manner. In the leaf which had all its tentacles except three inflected in 10 m., each gland (assuming that the leaf bore 160 tentacles) could have absorbed only 1/251200 of a grain, or .000258 mg. Four leaves were separately immersed as before in a solution of one part to 131,250 of water (1 gr. to 300 oz.), so that each received 1/4800 of a grain, or .0135 mg. After 50 m. one leaf had all its tentacles except sixteen, and after 8 hrs. 20 m. all but fourteen, inflected. The second leaf, after 40 m., had all but twenty inflected; and after 8 hrs. 10 m. began to re-expand. The third, in 3 hrs. had about half its tentacles inflected, which began to re-expand after 8 hrs. 15 m. The fourth leaf, after 3 hrs. 7 m., had only twenty-nine tentacles more or less inflected. Thus three out of the four leaves were strongly acted on. It is clear that very sensitive leaves had been accidentally selected. The day moreover was hot. The four corresponding leaves in water were likewise acted on rather more than is usual; for after 3 hrs. one had nine tentacles, another four, and another two, and the fourth none, inflected. With respect to the leaf of which all the tentacles, except sixteen, were inflected after 50 m., each gland (assuming that the leaf bore 160 tentacles) could have absorbed only 1/691200 of a grain (.0000937 mg.), and this appears to be about the least quantity of the nitrate which suffices to induce the inflection of a single tentacle. As negative results are important in confirming the foregoing positive ones, eight leaves were immersed as before, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part to 175,000 of water (1 gr. to 400 oz.), so that each received only 1/6400 of a grain (.0101 mg.). This minute quantity produced a slight effect on only four of the eight leaves. One had fifty-six tentacles inflected after 2 hrs. 13 m.; a second, twenty-six inflected, or sub-inflected, after [page 153] 38 m.; a third, eighteen inflected, after 1 hr.; and a fourth, ten inflected, after 35 m. The four other leaves were not in the least affected. Of the eight corresponding leaves in water, one had, after 2 hrs. 10 m., nine tentacles, and four others from one to four long-headed tentacles, inflected; the remaining three being unaffected. Hence, the 1/6400 of a grain given to a sensitive leaf during warm weather perhaps produces a slight effect; but we must bear in mind that occasionally water causes as great an amount of inflection as occurred in this last experiment.] A Summary of the Results with Nitrate of Ammonia.—The glands of the disc, when excited by a half-minim drop (.0296 ml.), containing 1/2400 of a grain of the nitrate (.027 mg.), transmit a motor impulse to the exterior tentacles, causing them to bend inwards. A minute drop, containing 1/28800 of a grain (.00225 mg.), if held for a few seconds in contact with a gland, causes the tentacle bearing this gland to be inflected. If a leaf is left immersed for a few hours, and sometimes for only a few minutes, in a solution of such strength that each gland can absorb only the (1/691200 of a grain (.0000937 mg.), this small amount is enough to excite each tentacle into movement, and it becomes closely inflected. PHOSPHATE OF AMMONIA. This salt is more powerful than the nitrate, even in a greater degree than the nitrate is more powerful than the carbonate. This is shown by weaker solutions of the phosphate acting when dropped on the discs, or applied to the glands of the exterior tentacles, or when leaves are immersed. The difference in the power of these three salts, as tried in three different ways, supports the results presently to be [page 154] given, which are so surprising that their credibility requires every kind of support. In 1872 I experimented on twelve immersed leaves, giving each only ten minims of a solution; but this was a bad method, for so small a quantity hardly covered them. None of these experiments will, therefore, be given, though they indicate that excessively minute doses are efficient. When I read over my notes, in 1873, I entirely disbelieved them, and determined to make another set of experiments with scrupulous care, on the same plan as those made with the nitrate; namely by placing leaves in watch-glasses, and pouring over each thirty minims of the solution under trial, treating at the same time and in the same manner other leaves with the distilled water used in making the solutions. During 1873, seventy-one leaves were thus tried in solutions of various strengths, and the same number in water. Notwithstanding the care taken and the number of the trials made, when in the following year I looked merely at the results, without reading over my observations, I again thought that there must have been some error, and thirty-five fresh trials were made with the weakest solution; but the results were as plainly marked as before. Altogether, 106 carefully selected leaves were tried, both in water and in solutions of the phosphate. Hence, after the most anxious consideration, I can entertain no doubt of the substantial accuracy of my results. [Before giving my experiments, it may be well to premise that crystallised phosphate of ammonia, such as I used, contains 35.33 per cent. of water of crystallisation; so that in all the following trials the efficient elements formed only 64.67 per cent. of the salt used. Extremely minute particles of the dry phosphate were placed [page 155] with the point of a needle on the secretion surrounding several glands. These poured forth much secretion, were blackened, and ultimately died; but the tentacles moved only slightly. The dose, small as it was, evidently was too great, and the result was the same as with particles of the carbonate of ammonia. Half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water were placed on the discs of three leaves and acted most energetically, causing the tentacles of one to be inflected in 15 m., and the blades of all three to be much curved inwards in 2 hrs. 15 m. Similar drops of a solution of one part to 1312 of water, (1 gr. to 3 oz.) were then placed on the discs of five leaves, so that each received the 1/2880 of a grain (.0225 mg.). After 8 hrs. the tentacles of four of them were considerably inflected, and after 24 hrs. the blades of three. After 48 hrs. all five were almost fully re-expanded. I may mention with respect to one of these leaves, that a drop of water had been left during the previous 24 hrs. on its disc, but produced no effect; and that this was hardly dry when the solution was added. Similar drops of a solution of one part to 1750 of water (1 gr. to 4 oz.) were next placed on the discs of six leaves; so that each received 1/3840 of a grain (.0169 mg.); after 8 hrs. three of them had many tentacles and their blades inflected; two others had only a few tentacles slightly inflected, and the sixth was not at all affected. After 24 hrs. most of the leaves had a few more tentacles inflected, but one had begun to re-expand. We thus see that with the more sensitive leaves the 1/3840 of a grain, absorbed by the central glands, is enough to make many of the exterior tentacles and the blades bend, whereas the 1/1920 of a grain of the carbonate similarly given produced no effect; and 1/2880 of a grain of the nitrate was only just sufficient to produce a well-marked effect. A minute drop, about equal to 1/20 of a minim, of a solution of one part of the phosphate to 875 of water, was applied to the secretion on three glands, each of which thus received only 1/57600 of a grain (.00112 mg.), and all three tentacles became inflected. Similar drops of a solution of one part to 1312 of water (1 gr. to 3 oz.) were now tried on three leaves; a drop being applied to four glands on the same leaf. On the first leaf, three of the tentacles became slightly inflected in 6 m., and re-expanded after 8 hrs. 45 m. On the second, two tentacles became sub-inflected in 12 m. And on the third all four tentacles were decidedly inflected in 12 m.; they remained so for 8 hrs. 30 m., but by the next morning were fully re-expanded. [page 156] In this latter case each gland could have received only the 1/115200 (or .000563 mg.) of a grain. Lastly, similar drops of a solution of one part to 1750 of water (1 gr. to 4 oz.) were tried on five leaves; a drop being applied to four glands on the same leaf. The tentacles on three of these leaves were not in the least affected; on the fourth leaf, two became inflected; whilst on the fifth, which happened to be a very sensitive one, all four tentacles were plainly inflected in 6 hrs. 15m.; but only one remained inflected after 24 hrs. I should, however, state that in this case an unusually large drop adhered to the head of the pin. Each of these glands could have received very little more than 1/153600 of a grain (or .000423); but this small quantity sufficed to cause inflection. We must bear in mind that these drops were applied to the viscid secretion for only from 10 to 15 seconds, and we have good reason to believe that all the phosphate in the solution would not be diffused and absorbed in this time. We have seen under the same circumstances that the absorption by a gland of 1/19200 of a grain of the carbonate, and of 1/57600 of a grain of the nitrate, did not cause the tentacle bearing the gland in question to be inflected; so that here again the phosphate is much more powerful than the other two salts. We will now turn to the 106 experiments with immersed leaves. Having ascertained by repeated trials that moderately strong solutions were highly efficient, I commenced with sixteen leaves, each placed in thirty minims of a solution of one part to 43,750 of water (1 gr. to 100 oz.); so that each received 1/1600 of a grain, or .04058 mg. Of these leaves, eleven had nearly all or a great number of their tentacles inflected in 1 hr., and the twelfth leaf in 3 hrs. One of the eleven had every single tentacle closely inflected in 50 m. Two leaves out of the sixteen were only moderately affected, yet more so than any of those simultaneously immersed in water; and the remaining two, which were pale leaves, were hardly at all affected. Of the sixteen corresponding leaves in water, one had nine tentacles, another six, and two others two tentacles inflected, in the course of 5 hrs. So that the contrast in appearance between the two lots was extremely great. Eighteen leaves were immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part to 87,500 of water (1 gr. to 200 oz.), so that each received 1/3200 of a grain (.0202 mg.). Fourteen of these were strongly inflected within 2 hrs., and some of them within 15 m.; three out of the eighteen were only slightly affected, having twenty-one, nineteen, and twelve tentacles in- [page 157] flected; and one was not at all acted on. By an accident only fifteen, instead of eighteen, leaves were immersed at the same time in water; these were observed for 24 hrs.; one had six, another four, and a third two, of their outer tentacles inflected; the remainder being quite unaffected. The next experiment was tried under very favourable circumstances, for the day (July 8) was very warm, and I happened to have unusually fine leaves. Five were immersed as before in a solution of one part to 131,250 of water (1 gr. to 300 oz.), so that each received 1/4800 of a grain, or .0135 mg. After an immersion of 25 m. all five leaves were much inflected. After 1 hr. 25 m. one leaf had all but eight tentacles inflected; the second, all but three; the third, all but five; the fourth; all but twenty-three; the fifth, on the other hand, never had more than twenty-four inflected. Of the corresponding five leaves in water, one had seven, a second two, a third ten, a fourth one, and a fifth none inflected. Let it be observed what a contrast is presented between these latter leaves and those in the solution. I counted the glands on the second leaf in the solution, and the number was 217; assuming that the three tentacles which did not become inflected absorbed nothing, we find that each of the 214 remaining glands could have absorbed only 1/l027200 of a grain, or .0000631 mg. The third leaf bore 236 glands, and subtracting the five which did not become inflected, each of the remaining 231 glands could have absorbed only 1/1108800 of a grain (or .0000584 mg.), and this amount sufficed to cause the tentacles to bend. Twelve leaves were tried as before in a solution of one part to 175,000 of water (1 gr. to 400 oz.), so that each leaf received 1/6400 of a grain (.0101 mg.). My plants were not at the time in a good state, and many of the leaves were young and pale. Nevertheless, two of them had all their tentacles, except three or four, closely inflected in under 1 hr. Seven were considerably affected, some within 1 hr., and others not until 3 hrs., 4 hrs. 30 m., and 8 hrs. had elapsed; and this slow action may be attributed to the leaves being young and pale. Of these nine leaves, four had their blades well inflected, and a fifth slightly so. The three remaining leaves were not affected. With respect to the twelve corresponding leaves in water, not one had its blade inflected; after from 1 to 2 hrs. one had thirteen of its outer tentacles inflected; a second six, and four others either one or two inflected. After 8 hrs. the outer tentacles did not become more inflected; whereas this occurred with the leaves in the solution. I record in my notes that [page 158] after the 8 hrs. it was impossible to compare the two lots, and doubt for an instant the power of the solution. Two of the above leaves in the solution had all their tentacles, except three and four, inflected within an hour. I counted their glands, and, on the same principle as before, each gland on one leaf could have absorbed only 1/1164800, and on the other leaf only 1/1472000, of a grain of the phosphate. Twenty leaves were immersed in the usual manner, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part to 218,750 of water (1 gr. to 500 oz.). So many leaves were tried because I was then under the false impression that it was incredible that any weaker solution could produce an effect. Each leaf received 1/8000 of a grain, or .0081 mg. The first eight leaves which I tried both in the solution and in water were either young and pale or too old; and the weather was not hot. They were hardly at all affected; nevertheless, it would be unfair to exclude them. I then waited until I got eight pairs of fine leaves, and the weather was favourable; the temperature of the room where the leaves were immersed varying from 75° to 81° (23°.8 to 27°.2 Cent.) In another trial with four pairs (included in the above twenty pairs), the temperature in my room was rather low, about 60° (15°.5 Cent.); but the plants had been kept for several days in a very warm greenhouse and thus rendered extremely sensitive. Special precautions were taken for this set of experiments; a chemist weighed for me a grain in an excellent balance; and fresh water, given me by Prof. Frankland, was carefully measured. The leaves were selected from a large number of plants in the following manner: the four finest were immersed in water, and the next four finest in the solution, and so on till the twenty pairs were complete. The water specimens were thus a little favoured, but they did not undergo more inflection than in the previous cases, comparatively with those in the solution. Of the twenty leaves in the solution, eleven became inflected within 40 m.; eight of them plainly and three rather doubtfully; but the latter had at least twenty of their outer tentacles inflected. Owing to the weakness of the solution, inflection occurred, except in No. 1, much more slowly than in the previous trials. The condition of the eleven leaves which were considerably inflected will now be given at stated intervals, always reckoning from the time of immersion:— (1) After only 8 m. a large number of tentacles inflected, and after 17 m. all but fifteen; after 2 hrs. all but eight in- [page 159] flected, or plainly sub-inflected. After 4 hrs. the tentacles began to re-expand, and such prompt re-expansion is unusual; after 7 hrs. 30 m. they were almost fully re-expanded. (2) After 39 m. a large number of tentacles inflected; after 2 hrs. 18 m. all but twenty-five inflected; after 4 hrs. 17 m. all but sixteen inflected. The leaf remained in this state for many hours. (3) After 12 m. a considerable amount of inflection; after 4 hrs. all the tentacles inflected except those of the two outer rows, and the leaf remained in this state for some time; after 23 hrs. began to re-expand. (4) After 40 m. much inflection; after 4 hrs. 13 m. fully half the tentacles inflected; after 23 hrs. still slightly inflected. (5) After 40 m. much inflection; after 4 hrs. 22 m. fully half the tentacles inflected; after 23 hrs. still slightly inflected. (6) After 40 m. some inflection; after 2 hrs. 18 m. about twenty-eight outer tentacles inflected; after 5 hrs. 20 m. about a third of the tentacles inflected; after 8 hrs. much re-expanded. (7) After 20 m. some inflection; after 2 hrs. a considerable number of tentacles inflected; after 7 hrs. 45 m. began to re-expand. (8) After 38 m. twenty-eight tentacles inflected; after 3 hrs. 45 m. thirty-three inflected, with most of the submarginal tentacles sub-inflected; continued so for two days, and then partially re-expanded. (9) After 38 m. forty-two tentacles inflected; after 3 hrs. 12 m. sixty-six inflected or sub-inflected; after 6 hrs. 40 m. all but twenty-four inflected or sub-inflected; after 9 hrs. 40 m. all but seventeen inflected; after 24 hrs. all but four inflected or sub-inflected, only a few being closely inflected; after 27 hrs. 40 m. the blade inflected. The leaf remained in this state for two days, and then began to re-expand. (10) After 38 m. twenty-one tentacles inflected; after 3 hrs. 12 m. forty-six tentacles inflected or sub-inflected; after 6 hrs. 40 m. all but seventeen inflected, though none closely; after 24 hrs. every tentacle slightly curved inwards; after 27 hrs. 40 m. blade strongly inflected, and so continued for two days, and then the tentacles and blade very slowly re-expanded. (11) This fine dark red and rather old leaf, though not very large, bore an extraordinary number of tentacles (viz. 252), and behaved in an anomalous manner. After 6 hrs. 40 m. only the short tentacles round the outer part of the disc were inflected, forming a ring, as so often occurs in from 8 to 24 hrs. With leaves both in water and the weaker solutions. But after 9 hrs. [page 160] 40 m. all the outer tentacles except twenty-five were inflected; as was the blade in a strongly marked manner. After 24 hrs. every tentacle except one was closely inflected, and the blade was completely doubled over. Thus the leaf remained for two days, when it began to re-expand. I may add that the three latter leaves (Nos. 9, 10, and 11) were still somewhat inflected after three days. The tentacles in but few of these eleven leaves became closelyinflected within so short a time as in the previous experiments with stronger solutions. We will now turn to the twenty corresponding leaves in water. Nine had none of their outer tentacles inflected; nine others had from one to three inflected; and these re-expanded after 8 hrs. The remaining two leaves were moderately affected; one having six tentacles inflected in 34 m.; the other twenty-three inflected in 2 hrs. 12 m.; and both thus remained for 24 hrs. None of these leaves had their blades inflected. So that the contrast between the twenty leaves in water and the twenty in the solution was very great, both within the first hour and after from 8 to 12 hrs. had elapsed. Of the leaves in the solution, the glands on leaf No. 1, which in 2 hrs. had all its tentacles except eight inflected, were counted and found to be 202. Subtracting the eight, each gland could have received only the 1/1552000 grain (.0000411 mg.) of the phosphate. Leaf No. 9 had 213 tentacles, all of which, with the exception of four, were inflected after 24 hrs., but none of them closely; the blade was also inflected; each gland could have received only the 1/1672000 of a grain, or .0000387 mg. Lastly, leaf No. 11, which had after 24 hrs. all its tentacles, except one, closely inflected, as well as the blade, bore the unusually large number of 252 tentacles; and on the same principle as before, each gland could have absorbed only the 1/2008000 of a grain, or .0000322 mg. With respect to the following experiments, I must premise that the leaves, both those placed in the solutions and in water, were taken from plants which had been kept in a very warm greenhouse during the winter. They were thus rendered extremely sensitive, as was shown by water exciting them much more than in the previous experiments. Before giving my observations, it may be well to remind the reader that, judging from thirty-one fine leaves, the average number of tentacles is 192, and that the outer or exterior ones, the movements of which are alone significant, are to the short ones on the disc in the proportion of about sixteen to nine. [page 161] Four leaves were immersed as before, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part to 328,125 of water (1 gr. to 750 oz.). Each leaf thus received 1/12000 of a grain (.0054 mg.) of the salt; and all four were greatly inflected. (1) After 1 hr. all the outer tentacles but one inflected, and the blade greatly so; after 7 hrs. began to re-expand. (2) After 1 hr. all the outer tentacles but eight inflected; after 12 hrs. all re-expanded. (3) After 1 hr. much inflection; after 2 hrs. 30 m. all the tentacles but thirty-six inflected; after 6 hrs. all but twenty-two inflected; after 12 hrs. partly re-expanded. (4) After 1 hr. all the tentacles but thirty-two inflected; after 2 hrs. 30 m. all but twenty-one inflected; after 6 hrs. almost re-expanded. Of the four corresponding leaves in water:— (1) After 1 hr. forty-five tentacles inflected; but after 7 hrs. so many had re-expanded that only ten remained much inflected. (2) After 1 hr. seven tentacles inflected; these were almost re-expanded in 6 hrs. (3) and (4) Not affected, except that, as usual, after 11 hrs. the short tentacles on the borders of the disc formed a ring. There can, therefore, be no doubt about the efficiency of the above solution; and it follows as before that each gland of No. 1 could have absorbed only 1/2412000 of a grain (.0000268 mg.) and of No. 2 only 1/2460000 of a grain (.0000263 mg.) of the phosphate. Seven leaves were immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part to 437,500 of water (1 gr. to 1000 oz.). Each leaf thus received 1/16000 of a grain (.00405 mg.). The day was warm, and the leaves were very fine, so that all circumstances were favourable. (1) After 30 m. all the outer tentacles except five inflected, and most of them closely; after 1 hr. blade slightly inflected; after 9 hrs. 30 m. began to re-expand. (2) After 33 m. all the outer tentacles but twenty-five inflected, and blade slightly so; after 1 hr. 30 m. blade strongly inflected and remained so for 24 hrs.; but some of the tentacles had then re-expanded. (3) After 1 hr. all but twelve tentacles inflected; after 2 hrs. 30 m. all but nine inflected; and of the inflected tentacles all excepting four closely; blade slightly inflected. After 8 hrs. blade quite doubled up, and now all the tentacles excepting [page 162] eight closely inflected. The leaf remained in this state for two days. (4) After 2 hrs. 20 m. only fifty-nine tentacles inflected; but after 5 hrs. all the tentacles closely inflected excepting two which were not affected, and eleven which were only sub-inflected; after 7 hrs. blade considerably inflected; after 12 hrs. much re-expansion. (5) After 4 hrs. all the tentacles but fourteen inflected; after 9 hrs. 30 m. beginning to re-expand. (6) After 1 hr. thirty-six tentacles inflected; after 5 hrs. all but fifty-four inflected; after 12 hrs. considerable re-expansion. (7) After 4 hrs. 30 m. only thirty-five tentacles inflected or sub-inflected, and this small amount of inflection never increased. Now for the seven corresponding leaves in water:— (1) After 4 hrs. thirty-eight tentacles inflected; but after 7 hrs. these, with the exception of six, re-expanded. (2) After 4 hrs. 20 m. twenty inflected; these after 9 hrs. partially re-expanded. (3) After 4 hrs. five inflected, which began to re-expand after 7 hrs. (4) After 24 hrs. one inflected. (5), (6) and (7) Not at all affected, though observed for 24 hrs., excepting the short tentacles on the borders of the disc, which as usual formed a ring. A comparison of the leaves in the solution, especially of the first five or even six on the list, with those in the water, after 1 hr. or after 4 hrs., and in a still more marked degree after 7 hrs. or 8 hrs., could not leave the least doubt that the solution had produced a great effect. This was shown not only by the vastly greater number of inflected tentacles, but by the degree or closeness of their inflection, and by that of their blades. Yet each gland on leaf No. 1 (which bore 255 glands, all of which, excepting five, were inflected in 30 m.) could not have received more than one-four-millionth of a grain (.0000162 mg.) of the salt. Again, each gland on leaf No. 3 (which bore 233 glands, all of which, except nine, were inflected in 2 hrs. 30 m.) could have received at most only the 1/3584000 of a grain, or .0000181 mg. Four leaves were immersed as before in a solution of one part to 656,250 of water (1 gr. to 1500 oz.); but on this occasion I happened to select leaves which were very little sensitive, as on other occasions I chanced to select unusually sensitive leaves. The leaves were not more affected after 12 hrs. than [page 163] the four corresponding ones in water; but after 24 hrs. they were slightly more inflected. Such evidence, however, is not at all trustworthy. Twelve leaves were immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part to 1,312,500 of water (1 gr. to 3000 oz.); so that each leaf received 1/48000 of a grain (.00135 mg.). The leaves were not in very good condition; four of them were too old and of a dark red colour; four were too pale, yet one of these latter acted well; the four others, as far as could be told by the eye, seemed in excellent condition. The result was as follows:— (1) This was a pale leaf; after 40 m. about thirty-eight tentacles inflected; after 3 hrs. 30 m. the blade and many of the outer tentacles inflected; after 10 hrs. 15 m. all the tentacles but seventeen inflected, and the blade quite doubled up; after 24 hrs. all the tentacles but ten more or less inflected. Most of them were closely inflected, but twenty-five were only sub-inflected. (2) After 1 hr. 40 m. twenty-five tentacles inflected; after 6 hrs. all but twenty-one inflected; after 10 hrs. all but sixteen more or less inflected; after 24 hrs. re-expanded. (3) After 1 hr. 40 m. thirty-five inflected; after 6 hrs. “a large number” (to quote my own memorandum) inflected, but from want of time they were not counted; after 24 hrs. re-expanded. (4) After 1 hr. 40 m. about thirty inflected; after 6 hrs. “a large number all round the leaf” inflected, but they were not counted; after 10 hrs. began to re-expand. (5) to (12) These were not more inflected than leaves often are in water, having respectively 16, 8, 10, 8, 4, 9, 14, and 0 tentacles inflected. Two of these leaves, however, were remarkable from having their blades slightly inflected after 6 hrs. With respect to the twelve corresponding leaves in water, (1) had, after 1 hr. 35 m., fifty tentacles inflected, but after 11 hrs. only twenty-two remained so, and these formed a group, with the blade at this point slightly inflected. It appeared as if this leaf had been in some manner accidentally excited, for instance by a particle of animal matter which was dissolved by the water. (2) After 1 hr. 45 m. thirty-two tentacles inflected, but after 5 hrs. 30 m. only twenty-five inflected, and these after 10 hrs. all re-expanded; (3) after 1 hr. twenty-five inflected, which after 10 hrs. 20 m. were all re-expanded; (4) and (5) after 1 hr. 35 m. six and seven tentacles inflected, which re-expanded after 11 hrs.; (6), (7) and (8) from one to three inflected, which [page 164] soon re-expanded; (9), (10), (11) and (12) none inflected, though observed for twenty-four hours. Comparing the states of the twelve leaves in water with those in the solution, there could be no doubt that in the latter a larger number of tentacles were inflected, and these to a greater degree; but the evidence was by no means so clear as in the former experiments with stronger solutions. It deserves attention that the inflection of four of the leaves in the solution went on increasing during the first 6 hrs., and with some of them for a longer time; whereas in the water the inflection of the three leaves which were the most affected, as well as of all the others, began to decrease during this same interval. It is also remarkable that the blades of three of the leaves in the solution were slightly inflected, and this is a most rare event with leaves in water, though it occurred to a slight extent in one (No. 1), which seemed to have been in some manner accidentally excited. All this shows that the solution produced some effect, though less and at a much slower rate than in the previous cases. The small effect produced may, however, be accounted for in large part by the majority of the leaves having been in a poor condition. Of the leaves in the solution, No. 1 bore 200 glands and received 1/48000 of a grain of the salt. Subtracting the seventeen tentacles which were not inflected, each gland could have absorbed only the 1/8784000 of a grain (.00000738 mg.). This amount caused the tentacle bearing each gland to be greatly inflected. The blade was also inflected. Lastly, eight leaves were immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part of the phosphate to 21,875,000 of water (1 gr. to 5000 oz.). Each leaf thus received 1/80000 of a grain of the salt, or .00081 mg. I took especial pains in selecting the finest leaves from the hot-house for immersion, both in the solution and the water, and almost all proved extremely sensitive. Beginning as before with those in the solution:— (1) After 2 hrs. 30 m. all the tentacles but twenty-two inflected, but some only sub-inflected; the blade much inflected; after 6 hrs. 30 m. all but thirteen inflected, with the blade immensely inflected; and remained so for 48 hrs. (2) No change for the first 12 hrs., but after 24 hrs. all the tentacles inflected, excepting those of the outermost row, of which only eleven were inflected. The inflection continued to increase, and after 48 hrs. all the tentacles except three were inflected, [page 165] and most of them rather closely, four or five being only sub-inflected. (3) No change for the first 12 hrs.; but after 24 hrs. all the tentacles excepting those of the outermost row were sub-inflected, with the blade inflected. After 36 hrs. blade strongly inflected, with all the tentacles, except three, inflected or sub-inflected. After 48 hrs. in the same state. (4) to (8) These leaves, after 2 hrs. 30 m., had respectively 32, 17, 7, 4, and 0 tentacles inflected, most of which, after a few hours, re-expanded, with the exception of No. 4, which retained its thirty-two tentacles inflected for 48 hrs. Now for the eight corresponding leaves in water:— (1) After 2 hrs. 40 m. this had twenty of its outer tentacles inflected, five of which re-expanded after 6 hrs. 30 m. After 10 hrs. 15 m. a most unusual circumstance occurred, namely, the whole blade became slightly bowed towards the footstalk, and so remained for 48 hrs. The exterior tentacles, excepting those of the three or four outermost rows, were now also inflected to an unusual degree. (2) to (8) These leaves, after 2 hrs. 40 m., had respectively 42, 12, 9, 8, 2, 1, and 0 tentacles inflected, which all re-expanded within 24 hrs., and most of them within a much shorter time. When the two lots of eight leaves in the solution and in the water were compared after the lapse of 24 hrs., they undoubtedly differed much in appearance. The few tentacles on the leaves in water which were inflected had after this interval re-expanded, with the exception of one leaf; and this presented the very unusual case of the blade being somewhat inflected, though in a degree hardly approaching that of the two leaves in the solution. Of these latter leaves, No. 1 had almost all its tentacles, together with its blade, inflected after an immersion of 2 hrs. 30 m. Leaves No. 2 and 3 were affected at a much slower rate; but after from 24 hrs. to 48 hrs. almost all their tentacles were closely inflected, and the blade of one quite doubled up. We must therefore admit, incredible as the fact may at first appear, that this extremely weak solution acted on the more sensitive leaves; each of which received only the 1/80000 of a grain (.00081 mg.) of the phosphate. Now, leaf No. 3 bore 178 tentacles, and subtracting the three which were not inflected, each gland could have absorbed only the 1/14000000 of a grain, or .00000463 mg. Leaf No. 1, which was strongly acted on within 2 hrs. 30 m., and had all its outer tentacles, except thirteen, inflected within 6 hrs. 30 m., bore 260 tentacles; and on the same principle as before, each gland could have [page 166] absorbed only 1/19760000 of a grain, or .00000328 mg.; and this excessively minute amount sufficed to cause all the tentacles bearing these glands to be greatly inflected. The blade was also inflected.] A Summary of the Results with Phosphate of Ammonia.—The glands of the disc, when excited by a half-minim drop (.0296 ml.), containing 1/3840 of a grain (.0169 mg.) of this salt, transmit a motor impulse to the exterior tentacles, causing them to bend inwards. A minute drop, containing 1/153600 of a grain (.000423 mg.), if held for a few seconds in contact with a gland, causes the tentacle bearing this gland to be inflected. If a leaf is left immersed for a few hours, and sometimes for a shorter time, in a solution so weak that each gland can absorb only the 1/9760000 of a grain (.00000328 mg.), this is enough to excite the tentacle into movement, so that it becomes closely inflected, as does sometimes the blade. In the general summary to this chapter a few remarks will be added, showing that the efficiency of such extremely minute doses is not so incredible as it must at first appear. [Sulphate of Ammonia.—The few trials made with this and the following five salts of ammonia were undertaken merely to ascertain whether they induced inflection. Half-minims of a solution of one part of the sulphate of ammonia to 437 of water were placed on the discs of seven leaves, so that each received 1/960 of a grain, or .0675 mg. After 1 hr. the tentacles of five of them, as well as the blade of one, were strongly inflected. The leaves were not afterwards observed. Citrate of Ammonia.—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water were placed on the discs of six leaves. In 1 hr. the short outer tentacles round the discs were a little inflected, with the glands on the discs blackened. After 3 hrs. 25 m. one leaf had its blade inflected, but none of the exterior tentacles. All six leaves remained in nearly the same state during the day, the submarginal tentacles, however, [page 167] becoming more inflected. After 23 hrs. three of the leaves had their blades somewhat inflected; and the submarginal tentacles of all considerably inflected, but in none were the two, three, or four outer rows affected. I have rarely seen cases like this, except from the action of a decoction of grass. The glands on the discs of the above leaves, instead of being almost black, as after the first hour, were now after 23 hrs. very pale. I next tried on four leaves half-minims of a weaker solution, of one part to 1312 of water (1 gr. to 3 oz.); so that each received 1/2880 of a grain (.0225 mg.). After 2 hrs. 18 m. the glands on the disc were very dark-coloured; after 24 hrs. two of the leaves were slightly affected; the other two not at all. Acetate of Ammonia.—Half-minims of a solution of about one part to 109 of water were placed on the discs of two leaves, both of which were acted on in 5 hrs. 30 m., and after 23 hrs. had every single tentacle closely inflected. Oxalate of Ammonia.—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 218 of water were placed on two leaves, which, after 7 hrs., became moderately, and after 23 hrs. strongly, inflected. Two other leaves were tried with a weaker solution of one part to 437 of water; one was strongly inflected in 7 hrs.; the other not until 30 hrs. had elapsed. Tartrate of Ammonia.—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water were placed on the discs of five leaves. In 31 m. there was a trace of inflection in the exterior tentacles of some of the leaves, and this became more decided after 1 hr. with all the leaves; but the tentacles were never closely inflected. After 8 hrs. 30 m. they began to re-expand. Next morning, after 23 hrs., all were fully re-expanded, excepting one which was still slightly inflected. The shortness of the period of inflection in this and the following case is remarkable. Chloride of Ammonium.—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water were placed on the discs of six leaves. A decided degree of inflection in the outer and submarginal tentacles was perceptible in 25 m.; and this increased during the next three or four hours, but never became strongly marked. After only 8 hrs. 30 m. the tentacles began to re-expand, and by the next morning, after 24 hrs., were fully re-expanded on four of the leaves, but still slightly inflected on two.] General Summary and Concluding Remarks on the Salts of Ammonia.—We have now seen that the nine [page 168] salts of ammonia which were tried, all cause the inflection of the tentacles, and often of the blade of the leaf. As far as can be ascertained from the superficial trials with the last six salts, the citrate is the least powerful, and the phosphate certainly by far the most. The tartrate and chloride are remarkable from the short duration of their action. The relative efficiency of the carbonate, nitrate, and phosphate, is shown in the following table by the smallest amount which suffices to cause the inflection of the tentacles. Column 1 : Solutions, how applied. Column 2 : Carbonate of Ammonia. Column 3 : Nitrate of Ammonia. Column 4 : Phosphate of Ammonia. Placed on the glands of the disc, so as to act indirectly on the outer tentacles : 1/960 of a grain, or 0675 mg. : 1/2400 of a grain, or .027 mg. : 1/3840 of a grain, or .0169 mg. Applied for a few seconds directly to the gland of an outer tentacle : 1/14400 of a grain, or .00445 mg. : 1/28800 of a grain, or .0025 mg. grain, 1/153600 of a grain, or .000423 mg. Leaf immersed, with time allowed for each gland to absorb all that it can : 1/268800 of a grain, or .00024 mg. : 1/691200 of a grain, or .0000937 mg. : 1/19760000 of a grain, or .00000328 mg. Amount absorbed by a gland which suffices to cause the aggregation of the protoplasm in the adjoining cells of the tentacles. 1/134400 of a grain, or .00048 mg. From the experiments tried in these three different ways, we see that the carbonate, which contains 23.7 per cent. of nitrogen, is less efficient than the nitrate, which contains 35 per cent. The phosphate contains less nitrogen than either of these salts, namely, only 21.2 per cent., and yet is far more [page 169] efficient; its power no doubt depending quite as much on the phosphorus as on the nitrogen which it contains. We may infer that this is the case, from the energetic manner in which bits of bone and phosphate of lime affect the leaves. The inflection excited by the other salts of ammonia is probably due solely to their nitrogen,—on the same principle that nitrogenous organic fluids act powerfully, whilst non-nitrogenous organic fluids are powerless. As such minute doses of the salts of ammonia affect the leaves, we may feel almost sure that Drosera absorbs and profits by the amount, though small, which is present in rain-water, in the same manner as other plants absorb these same salts by their roots. The smallness of the doses of the nitrate, and more especially of the phosphate of ammonia, which cause the tentacles of immersed leaves to be inflected, is perhaps the most remarkable fact recorded in this volume. When we see that much less than the millionth* of a grain of the phosphate, absorbed by a gland of one of the exterior tentacles, causes it to bend, it may be thought that the effects of the solution on the glands of the disc have been overlooked; namely, the transmission of a motor impulse from them to the exterior tentacles. No doubt the movements of the latter are thus aided; but the aid thus rendered must be insignificant; for we know that a drop containing as much as the 1/3840 of a grain placed on the disc is only just able to cause the outer tentacles of a highly sensitive leaf to bend. It is cer- * It is scarcely possible to realise what a million means. The best illustration which I have met with is that given by Mr. Croll, who says,—Take a narrow strip of paper 83 ft. 4 in. in length, and stretch it along the wall of a large hall; then mark off at one end the tenth of an inch. This tenth will represent a hundred, and the entire strip a million. [page 170] tainly a most surprising fact that the 1/19760000 of a grain, or in round numbers the one-twenty-millionth of a grain (.0000033 mg.), of the phosphate should affect any plant, or indeed any animal; and as this salt contains 35.33 per cent. of water of crystallisation, the efficient elements are reduced to 1/30555126 of a grain, or in round numbers to one-thirty-millionth of a grain (.00000216 mg.). The solution, moreover, in these experiments was diluted in the proportion of one part of the salt to 2,187,500 of water, or one grain to 5000 oz. The reader will perhaps best realise this degree of dilution by remembering that 5000 oz. would more than fill a 31-gallon cask; and that to this large body of water one grain of the salt was added; only half a drachm, or thirty minims, of the solution being poured over a leaf. Yet this amount sufficed to cause the inflection of almost every tentacle, and often of the blade of the leaf. I am well aware that this statement will at first appear incredible to almost everyone. Drosera is far from rivalling the power of the spectroscope, but it can detect, as shown by the movements of its leaves, a very much smaller quantity of the phosphate of ammonia than the most skilful chemist can of any substance.* My results were for a long time incredible * When my first observations were made on the nitrate of ammonia, fourteen years ago, the powers of the spectroscope had not been discovered; and I felt all the greater interest in the then unrivalled powers of Drosera. Now the spectroscope has altogether beaten Drosera; for according to Bunsen and Kirchhoff probably less than one 1/200000000 of a grain of sodium can be thus detected (see Balfour Stewart, ‘Treatise on Heat,’ 2nd edit. 1871, p. 228). With respect to ordinary chemical tests, I gather from Dr. Alfred Taylor’s work on ‘Poisons’ that about 1/4000 of a grain of arsenic, 1/4400 of a grain of prussic acid, 1/1400 of iodine, and 1/2000 of tartarised antimony, can be detected; but the power of detection depends much on the solutions under trial not being extremely weak. [page 171] even to myself, and I anxiously sought for every source of error. The salt was in some cases weighed for me by a chemist in an excellent balance; and fresh water was measured many times with care. The observations were repeated during several years. Two of my sons, who were as incredulous as myself, compared several lots of leaves simultaneously immersed in the weaker solutions and in water, and declared that there could be no doubt about the difference in their appearance. I hope that some one may hereafter be induced to repeat my experiments; in this case he should select young and vigorous leaves, with the glands surrounded by abundant secretion. The leaves should be carefully cut off and laid gently in watch-glasses, and a measured quantity of the solution and of water poured over each. The water used must be as absolutely pure as it can be made. It is to be especially observed that the experiments with the weaker solutions ought to be tried after several days of very warm weather. Those with the weakest solutions should be made on plants which have been kept for a considerable time in a warm greenhouse, or cool hothouse; but this is by no means necessary for trials with solutions of moderate strength. I beg the reader to observe that the sensitiveness or irritability of the tentacles was ascertained by three different methods—indirectly by drops placed on the disc, directly by drops applied to the glands of the outer tentacles, and by the immersion of whole leaves; and it was found by these three methods that the nitrate was more powerful than the carbonate, and the phosphate much more powerful than the nitrate; this result being intelligible from the difference in the amount of nitrogen in the first two salts, and from the presence of phosphorus in the third. It may aid the [page 172] reader’s faith to turn to the experiments with a solution of one grain of the phosphate to 1000 oz. of water, and he will there find decisive evidence that the one-four-millionth of a grain is sufficient to cause the inflection of a single tentacle. There is, therefore, nothing very improbable in the fifth of this weight, or the one-twenty-millionth of a grain, acting on the tentacle of a highly sensitive leaf. Again, two of the leaves in the solution of one grain to 3000 oz., and three of the leaves in the solution of one grain to 5000 oz., were affected, not only far more than the leaves tried at the same time in water, but incomparably more than any five leaves which can be picked out of the 173 observed by me at different times in water. There is nothing remarkable in the mere fact of the one-twenty-millionth of a grain of the phosphate, dissolved in above two-million times its weight of water, being absorbed by a gland. All physiologists admit that the roots of plants absorb the salts of ammonia brought to them by the rain; and fourteen gallons of rain-water contain* a grain of ammonia, therefore only a little more than twice as much as in the weakest solution employed by me. The fact which appears truly wonderful is, that the one-twenty-millionth of a grain of the phosphate of ammonia (including less than the one-thirty-millionth of efficient matter), when absorbed by a gland, should induce some change in it, which leads to a motor impulse being transmitted down the whole length of the tentacle, causing the basal part to bend, often through an angle of above 180 degrees. Astonishing as is this result, there is no sound reason * Miller’s ‘Elements of Chemistry,’ part ii. p. 107, 3rd edit. 1864. [page 173] why we should reject it as incredible. Prof. Donders, of Utrecht, informs me that from experiments formerly made by him and Dr. De Ruyter, he inferred that less than the one-millionth of a grain of sulphate of atropine, in an extremely diluted state, if applied directly to the iris of a dog, paralyses the muscles of this organ. But, in fact, every time that we perceive an odour, we have evidence that infinitely smaller particles act on our nerves. When a dog stands a quarter of a mile to leeward of a deer or other animal, and perceives its presence, the odorous particles produce some change in the olfactory nerves; yet these particles must be infinitely smaller* than those of the phosphate of ammonia weighing the one-twenty-millionth of a grain. These nerves then transmit some influence to the brain of the dog, which leads to action on its part. With Drosera, the really marvellous fact is, that a plant without any specialised nervous system should be affected by such minute particles; but we have no grounds for assuming that other tissues could not be rendered as exquisitely susceptible to impressions from without if this were beneficial to the organism, as is the nervous system of the higher animals. * My son, George Darwin, has calculated for me the diameter of a sphere of phosphate of ammonia (specific gravity 1.678), weighing the one-twenty-millionth of a grain, and finds it to be 1/1644 of an inch. Now, Dr. Klein informs me that the smallest Micrococci, which are distinctly discernible under a power of 800 diameters, are estimated to be from .0002 to .0005 of a millimetre—that is, from 1/50800 to 1/127000 of an inch—in diameter. Therefore, an object between 1/31 and 1/77 of the size of a sphere of the phosphate of ammonia of the above weight can be seen under a high power; and no one supposes that odorous particles, such as those emitted from the deer in the above illustration, could be seen under any power of the microscope.)

Salts of sodium, potassium, and other alkaline, earthy, and metallic salts—Summary on the action of these salts—Various acids—Summary on their action. Having found that the salts of ammonia were so powerful, I was led to investigate the action of some other salts. It will be convenient, first, to give a list of the substances tried (including forty-nine salts and two metallic acids), divided into two columns, showing those which cause inflection, and those which do not do so, or only doubtfully. My experiments were made by placing half-minim drops on the discs of leaves, or, more commonly, by immersing them in the solutions; and sometimes by both methods. A summary of the results, with some concluding remarks, will then be given. The action of various acids will afterwards be described. COLUMN 1 : SALTS CAUSING INFLECTION.

[page 176] Sodium, Carbonate of (pure, given me by Prof. Hoffmann).—Half-minims (.0296 ml.) of a solution of one part to 218 of water (2 grs. to 1 oz.) were placed on the discs of twelve leaves. Seven of these became well inflected; three had only two or three of their outer tentacles inflected, and the remaining two were quite unaffected. But the dose, though only the 1/480 of a grain (.135 mg.), was evidently too strong, for three of the seven well-inflected leaves were killed. On the other hand, one of the seven, which had only a few tentacles inflected, re-expanded and seemed quite healthy after 48 hrs. By employing a weaker solution (viz. one part to 437 of water, or 1 gr. to 1 oz.), doses of 1/960 of a grain (.0675 mg.) were given to six leaves. Some of these were affected in 37 m.; and in 8 hrs. the outer tentacles of all, as well as the blades of two, were considerably inflected. After 23 hrs. 15 m. the tentacles had almost re-expanded, but the blades of the two were still just perceptibly curved inwards. After 48 hrs. all six leaves were fully re-expanded, and appeared perfectly healthy. Three leaves were immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part to 875 of water (1 gr. to 2 oz.), so that each received 1/32 of a grain (2.02 mg.); after 40 m. the three were much affected, and after 6 hrs. 45 m. the tentacles of all and the blade of one closely inflected. Sodium, Nitrate of (pure).—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water, containing 1/960 of a grain (.0675 mg.), were placed on the discs of five leaves. After 1 hr. 25 m. the tentacles of nearly all, and the blade of one, were somewhat inflected. The inflection continued to increase, and in 21 hrs. 15 m. the tentacles and the blades of four of them were greatly affected, and the blade of the fifth to a slight extent. After an additional 24 hrs. the four leaves still remained closely inflected, whilst the fifth was beginning to expand. Four days after the solution had been applied, two of the leaves had quite, and one had partially, re-expanded; whilst the remaining two remained closely inflected and appeared injured. Three leaves were immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part to 875 of water; in 1 hr. there was great inflection, and after 8 hrs. 15 m. every tentacle and the blades of all three were most strongly inflected. Sodium, Sulphate of.—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water were placed on the discs of six leaves. After 5 hrs. 30 m. the tentacles of three of them, (with the blade of one) were considerably; and those of the other three slightly, inflected. After 21 hrs. the inflection had a little decreased, [page 177] and in 45 hrs. the leaves were fully expanded, appearing quite healthy. Three leaves were immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part of the sulphate to 875 of water; after 1 hr. 30 m. there was some inflection, which increased so much that in 8 hrs. 10 m. all the tentacles and the blades of all three leaves were closely inflected. Sodium, Phosphate of.—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water were placed on the discs of six leaves. The solution acted with extraordinary rapidity, for in 8 m. the outer tentacles on several of the leaves were much incurved. After 6 hrs. the tentacles of all six leaves, and the blades of two, were closely inflected. This state of things continued for 24 hrs., excepting that the blade of a third leaf became incurved. After 48 hrs. all the leaves re-expanded. It is clear that 1/960 of a grain of phosphate of soda has great power in causing inflection. Sodium, Citrate of.—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water were placed on the discs of six leaves, but these were not observed until 22 hrs. had elapsed. The sub-marginal tentacles of five of them, and the blades of four, were then found inflected; but the outer rows of tentacles were not affected. One leaf, which appeared older than the others, was very little affected in any way. After 46 hrs. four of the leaves were almost re-expanded, including their blades. Three leaves were also immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part of the citrate to 875 of water; they were much acted on in 25 m.; and after 6 hrs. 35 m. almost all the tentacles, including those of the outer rows, were inflected, but not the blades. Sodium, Oxalate of.—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water were placed on the discs of seven leaves; after 5 hrs. 30 m. the tentacles of all, and the blades of most of them, were much affected. In 22 hrs., besides the inflection of the tentacles, the blades of all seven leaves were so much doubled over that their tips and bases almost touched. On no other occasion have I seen the blades so strongly affected. Three leaves were also immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part to 875 of water; after 30 m. there was much inflection, and after 6 hrs. 35 m. the blades of two and the tentacles of all were closely inflected. Sodium, Chloride of (best culinary salt).—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 218 of water were placed on the discs [page 178] of four leaves. Two, apparently, were not at all affected in 48 hrs.; the third had its tentacles slightly inflected; whilst the fourth had almost all its tentacles inflected in 24 hrs., and these did not begin to re-expand until the fourth day, and were not perfectly expanded on the seventh day. I presume that this leaf was injured by the salt. Half-minims of a weaker solution, of one part to 437 of water, were then dropped on the discs of six leaves, so that each received 1/960 of a grain. In 1 hr. 33 m. there was slight inflection; and after 5 hrs. 30 m. the tentacles of all six leaves were considerably, but not closely, inflected. After 23 hrs. 15 m. all had completely re-expanded, and did not appear in the least injured. Three leaves were immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part to 875 of water, so that each received 1/32 of a grain, or 2.02 mg. After 1 hr. there was much inflection; after 8 hrs. 30 m. all the tentacles and the blades of all three were closely inflected. Four other leaves were also immersed in the solution, each receiving the same amount of salt as before, viz. 1/32 of a grain. They all soon became inflected; after 48 hrs. they began to re-expand, and appeared quite uninjured, though the solution was sufficiently strong to taste saline. Sodium, Iodide of.—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water were placed on the discs of six leaves. After 24 hrs. four of them had their blades and many tentacles inflected. The other two had only their submarginal tentacles inflected; the outer ones in most of the leaves being but little affected. After 46 hrs. the leaves had nearly re-expanded. Three leaves were also immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part to 875 of water. After 6 hrs. 30 m. almost all the tentacles, and the blade of one leaf, were closely inflected. Sodium, Bromide of.—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water were placed on six leaves. After 7 hrs. there was some inflection; after 22 hrs. three of the leaves had their blades and most of their tentacles inflected; the fourth leaf was very slightly, and the fifth and sixth hardly at all, affected. Three leaves were also immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part to 875 of water; after 40 m. there was some inflection; after 4 hrs. the tentacles of all three leaves and the blades of two were inflected. These leaves were then placed in water, and after 17 hrs. 30 m. two of them were almost completely, and the third partially, re-expanded; so that apparently they were not injured. [page 179] Potassium, Carbonate of (pure).—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water were placed on six leaves. No effect was produced in 24 hrs.; but after 48 hrs. some of the leaves had their tentacles, and one the blade, considerably inflected. This, however, seemed the result of their being injured; for on the third day after the solution was given, three of the leaves were dead, and one was very unhealthy; the other two were recovering, but with several of their tentacles apparently injured, and these remained permanently inflected. It is evident that the 1/960 of a grain of this salt acts as a poison. Three leaves were also immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part to 875 of water, though only for 9 hrs.; and, very differently from what occurs with the salts of soda, no inflection ensued. Potassium, Nitrate of.—Half-minims of a strong solution, of one part to 109 of water (4 grs. to 1 oz.), were placed on the discs of four leaves; two were much injured, but no inflection ensued. Eight leaves were treated in the same manner, with drops of a weaker solution, of one part to 218 of water. After 50 hrs. there was no inflection, but two of the leaves seemed injured. Five of these leaves were subsequently tested with drops of milk and a solution of gelatine on their discs, and only one became inflected; so that the solution of the nitrate of the above strength, acting for 50 hrs., apparently had injured or paralysed the leaves. Six leaves were then treated in the same manner with a still weaker solution, of one part to 437 of water, and these, after 48 hrs., were in no way affected, with the exception of perhaps a single leaf. Three leaves were next immersed for 25 hrs., each in thirty minims of a solution of one part to 875 of water, and this produced no apparent effect. They were then put into a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 218 of water; the glands were immediately blackened, and after 1 hr. there was some inflection, and the protoplasmic contents of the cells became plainly aggregated. This shows that the leaves had not been much injured by their immersion for 25 hrs. in the nitrate. Potassium, Sulphate of.—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water were placed on the discs of six leaves. After 20 hrs. 30 m. no effect was produced; after an additional 24 hrs. three remained quite unaffected; two seemed injured, and the sixth seemed almost dead with its tentacles inflected. Nevertheless, after two additional days, all six leaves recovered. The immersion of three leaves for 24 hrs., each in thirty minims of [page 180] a solution of one part to 875 of water, produced no apparent effect. They were then treated with the same solution of carbonate of ammonia, with the same result as in the case of the nitrate of potash. Potassium, Phosphate of.—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water were placed on the discs of six leaves, which were observed during three days; but no effect was produced. The partial drying up of the fluid on the disc slightly drew together the tentacles on it, as often occurs in experiments of this kind. The leaves on the third day appeared quite healthy. Potassium, Citrate of.—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water, left on the discs of six leaves for three days, and the immersion of three leaves for 9 hrs., each in 30 minims of a solution of one part to 875 of water, did not produce the least effect. Potassium, Oxalate of.—Half-minims were placed on different occasions on the discs of seventeen leaves; and the results perplexed me much, as they still do. Inflection supervened very slowly. After 24 hrs. four leaves out of the seventeen were well inflected, together with the blades of two; six were slightly affected, and seven not at all. Three leaves of one lot were observed for five days, and all died; but in another lot of six, all excepting one looked healthy after four days. Three leaves were immersed during 9 hrs., each in 30 minims of a solution of one part to 875 of water, and were not in the least affected; but they ought to have been observed for a longer time. Potassium, Chloride of. Neither half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water; left on the discs of six leaves for three days, nor the immersion of three leaves during 25 hrs., in 30 minims of a solution of one part to 875 of water, produced the least effect. The immersed leaves were then treated with carbonate of ammonia, as described under nitrate of potash, and with the same result. Potassium, Iodide of.—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water were placed on the discs of seven leaves. In 30 m. one leaf had the blade inflected; after some hours three leaves had most of their submarginal tentacles moderately inflected; the remaining three being very slightly affected. Hardly any of these leaves had their outer tentacles inflected. After 21 hrs. all re-expanded, excepting two which still had a few submarginal tentacles inflected. Three leaves were next [page 181] immersed for 8 hrs. 40 m., each in 30 minims of a solution of one part to 875 of water, and were not in the least affected. I do not know what to conclude from this conflicting evidence; but it is clear that the iodide of potassium does not generally produce any marked effect. Potassium, Bromide of.—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water were placed on the discs of six leaves; after 22 hrs. one had its blade and many tentacles inflected, but I suspect that an insect might have alighted on it and then escaped; the five other leaves were in no way affected. I tested three of these leaves with bits of meat, and after 24 hrs. they became splendidly inflected. Three leaves were also immersed for 21 hrs. in 30 minims of a solution of one part to 875 of water; but they were not at all affected, excepting that the glands looked rather pale. Lithium, Acetate of.—Four leaves were immersed together in a vessel containing 120 minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water; so that each received, if the leaves absorbed equally, 1/16 of a grain. After 24 hrs. there was no inflection. I then added, for the sake of testing the leaves, some strong solution (viz. 1 gr. to 20 oz., or one part to 8750 of water) of phosphate of ammonia, and all four became in 30 m. closely inflected. Lithium, Nitrate of.—Four leaves were immersed, as in the last case, in 120 minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water; after 1 h. 30 m. all four were a little, and after 24 hrs. greatly, inflected. I then diluted the solution with some water, but they still remained somewhat inflected on the third day. Caesium, Chloride of.—Four leaves were immersed, as above, in 120 minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water. After 1 hr. 5 m. the glands were darkened; after 4 hrs. 20 m. there was a trace of inflection; after 6 hrs. 40 m. two leaves were greatly, but not closely, and the other two considerably inflected. After 22 hrs. the inflection was extremely great, and two had their blades inflected. I then transferred the leaves into water, and in 46 hrs. from their first immersion they were almost re-expanded. Rubidium, Chloride of.—Four leaves which were immersed, as above, in 120 minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water, were not acted on in 22 hrs. I then added some of the strong solution (1 gr. to 20 oz.) of phosphate of ammonia, and in 30 m. all were immensely inflected. Silver, Nitrate of.—Three leaves were immersed in ninety [page 182] minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water; so that each received, as before, 1/16 of a grain. After 5 m. slight inflection, and after 11 m. very strong inflection, the glands becoming excessively black; after 40 m. all the tentacles were closely inflected. After 6 hrs. the leaves were taken out of the solution, washed, and placed in water; but next morning they were evidently dead. Calcium, Acetate of.—Four leaves were immersed in 120 minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water; after 24 hrs. none of the tentacles were inflected, excepting a few where the blade joined the petiole; and this may have been caused by the absorption of the salt by the cut-off end of the petiole. I then added some of the solution (1 gr. to 20 oz.) of phosphate of ammonia, but this to my surprise excited only slight inflection, even after 24 hrs. Hence it would appear that the acetate had rendered the leaves torpid. Calcium, Nitrate of.—Four leaves were immersed in 120 minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water, but were not affected in 24 hrs. I then added some of the solution of phosphate of ammonia (1 gr. to 20 oz.), but this caused only very slight inflection after 24 hrs. A fresh leaf was next put into a mixed solution of the above strengths of the nitrate of calcium and phosphate of ammonia, and it became closely inflected in between 5 m. and 10 m. Half-minims of a solution of one part of the nitrate of calcium to 218 of water were dropped on the discs of three leaves, but produced no effect. Magnesium, Acetate, Nitrate, and Chloride of.—Four leaves were immersed in 120 minims of solutions, of one part to 437 of water, of each of these three salts; after 6 hrs. there was no inflection; but after 22 hrs. one of the leaves in the acetate was rather more inflected than generally occurs from an immersion for this length of time in water. Some of the solution (1 gr. to 20 oz.) of phosphate of ammonia was then added to the three solutions. The leaves in the acetate mixed with the phosphate underwent some inflection; and this was well pronounced after 24 hrs. Those in the mixed nitrate were decidedly inflected in 4 hrs. 30 m., but the degree of inflection did not afterwards much increase; whereas the four leaves in the mixed chloride were greatly inflected in a few minutes, and after 4 hrs. had almost every tentacle closely inflected. We thus see that the acetate and nitrate of magnesium injure the leaves, or at least prevent the subsequent action of phosphate of ammonia; whereas the chloride has no such tendency. [page 183] Magnesium, Sulphate of.—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 218 of water were placed on the discs of ten leaves, and produced no effect. Barium, Acetate of.—Four leaves were immersed in 120 minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water, and after 22 hrs. there was no inflection, but the glands were blackened. The leaves were then placed in a solution (1 gr. to 20 oz.) of phosphate of ammonia, which caused after 26 hrs. only a little inflection in two of the leaves. Barium, Nitrate of.—Four leaves were immersed in 120 minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water; and after 22 hrs. there was no more than that slight degree of inflection, which often follows from an immersion of this length in pure water. I then added some of the same solution of phosphate of ammonia, and after 30 m. one leaf was greatly inflected, two others moderately, and the fourth not at all. The leaves remained in this state for 24 hrs. Strontium, Acetate of.—Four leaves, immersed in 120 minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water, were not affected in 22 hrs. They were then placed in some of the same solution of phosphate of ammonia, and in 25 m. two of them were greatly inflected; after 8 hrs. the third leaf was considerably inflected, and the fourth exhibited a trace of inflection. They were in the same state next morning. Strontium, Nitrate of.—Five leaves were immersed in 120 minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water; after 22 hrs. there was some slight inflection, but not more than sometimes occurs with leaves in water. They were then placed in the same solution of phosphate of ammonia; after 8 hrs. three of them were moderately inflected, as were all five after 24 hrs.; but not one was closely inflected. It appears that the nitrate of strontium renders the leaves half torpid. Cadmium, Chloride of.—Three leaves were immersed in ninety minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water; after 5 hrs. 20 m. slight inflection occurred, which increased during the next three hours. After 24 hrs. all three leaves had their tentacles well inflected, and remained so for an additional 24 hrs.; glands not discoloured. Mercury, Perchloride of.—Three leaves were immersed in ninety minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water; after 22 m. there was some slight inflection, which in 48 m. became well pronounced; the glands were now blackened. After 5 hrs. 35 m. all the tentacles closely inflected; after 24 hrs. still [page 184] inflected and discoloured. The leaves were then removed and left for two days in water; but they never re-expanded, being evidently dead. Zinc, Chloride of.—Three leaves immersed in ninety minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water were not affected in 25 hrs. 30 m. Aluminium, Chloride of.—Four leaves were immersed in 120 minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water; after 7 hrs. 45 m. no inflection; after 24 hrs. one leaf rather closely, the second moderately, the third and fourth hardly at all, inflected. The evidence is doubtful, but I think some power in slowly causing inflection must be attributed to this salt. These leaves were then placed in the solution (1 gr. to 20 oz.) of phosphate of ammonia, and after 7 hrs. 30 m. the three, which had been but little affected by the chloride, became rather closely inflected. Aluminium, Nitrate of.—Four leaves were immersed in 120 minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water; after 7 hrs. 45 m. there was only a trace of inflection; after 24 hrs. one leaf was moderately inflected. The evidence is here again doubtful, as in the case of the chloride of aluminium. The leaves were then transferred to the same solution, as before, of phosphate of ammonia; this produced hardly any effect in 7 hrs. 30 m.; but after 25 hrs. one leaf was pretty closely inflected, the three others very slightly, perhaps not more so than from water. Aluminium and Potassium, Sulphate of (common alum).—Half-minims of a solution of the usual strength were placed on the discs of nine leaves, but produced no effect. Gold, Chloride of.—Seven leaves were immersed in so much of a solution of one part to 437 of water that each received 30 minims, containing 1/16 of a grain, or 4.048 mg., of the chloride. There was some inflection in 8 m., which became extreme in 45 m. In 3 hrs. the surrounding fluid was coloured purple, and the glands were blackened. After 6 hrs. the leaves were transferred to water; next morning they were found discoloured and evidently killed. The secretion decomposes the chloride very readily; the glands themselves becoming coated with the thinnest layer of metallic gold, and particles float about on the surface of the surrounding fluid. Lead, Chloride of.—Three leaves were immersed in ninety minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water. After 23 hrs. there was not a trace of inflection; the glands were not blackened, and the leaves did not appear injured. They were then trans- [page 185] ferred to the solution (1 gr. to 20 oz.) of phosphate of ammonia, and after 24 hrs. two of them were somewhat, the third very little, inflected; and they thus remained for another 24 hrs. Tin, Chloride of.—Four leaves were immersed in 120 minims of a solution of about one part (all not being dissolved) to 437 of water. After 4 hrs. no effect; after 6 hrs. 30 m. all four leaves had their submarginal tentacles inflected; after 22 hrs. every single tentacle and the blades were closely inflected. The surrounding fluid was now coloured pink. The leaves were washed and transferred to water, but next morning were evidently dead. This chloride is a deadly poison, but acts slowly. Antimony, Tartrate of.—Three leaves were immersed in ninety minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water. After 8 hrs. 30 m. there was slight inflection; after 24 hrs. two of the leaves were closely, and the third moderately, inflected; glands not much darkened. The leaves were washed and placed in water, but they remained in the same state for 48 additional hours. This salt is probably poisonous, but acts slowly. Arsenious Acid.—A solution of one part to 437 of water; three leaves were immersed in ninety minims; in 25 m. considerable inflection; in 1 h. great inflection; glands not discoloured. After 6 hrs. the leaves were transferred to water; next morning they looked fresh, but after four days were pale-coloured, had not re-expanded, and were evidently dead. Iron, Chloride of.—Three leaves were immersed in ninety minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water; in 8 hrs. no inflection; but after 24 hrs. considerable inflection; glands blackened; fluid coloured yellow, with floating flocculent particles of oxide of iron. The leaves were then placed in water; after 48 hrs. they had re-expanded a very little, but I think were killed; glands excessively black. Chromic Acid.—One part to 437 of water; three leaves were immersed in ninety minims; in 30 m. some, and in 1 hr. considerable, inflection; after 2 hrs. all the tentacles closely inflected, with the glands discoloured. Placed in water, next day leaves quite discoloured and evidently killed. Manganese, Chloride of.—Three leaves immersed in ninety minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water; after 22 hrs. no more inflection than often occurs in water; glands not blackened. The leaves were then placed in the usual solution of phosphate of ammonia, but no inflection was caused even after 48 hrs. Copper, Chloride of.—Three leaves immersed in ninety minims [page 186] of a solution of one part to 437 of water; after 2 hrs. some inflection; after 3 hrs. 45 m. tentacles closely inflected, with the glands blackened. After 22 hrs. still closely inflected, and the leaves flaccid. Placed in pure water, next day evidently dead. A rapid poison. Nickel, Chloride of.—Three leaves immersed in ninety minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water; in 25 m. considerable inflection, and in 3 hrs. all the tentacles closely inflected. After 22 hrs. still closely inflected; most of the glands, but not all, blackened. The leaves were then placed in water; after 24 hrs. remained inflected; were somewhat discoloured, with the glands and tentacles dingy red. Probably killed. Cobalt, Chloride of.—Three leaves immersed in ninety minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water; after 23 hrs. there was not a trace of inflection, and the glands were not more blackened than often occurs after an equally long immersion in water. Platinum, Chloride of.—Three leaves immersed in ninety minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water; in 6 m. some inflection, which became immense after 48 m. After 3 hrs. the glands were rather pale. After 24 hrs. all the tentacles still closely inflected; glands colourless; remained in same state for four days; leaves evidently killed.] Concluding Remarks on the Action of the foregoing Salts.—Of the fifty-one salts and metallic acids which were tried, twenty-five caused the tentacles to be inflected, and twenty-six had no such effect, two rather doubtful cases occurring in each series. In the table at the head of this discussion, the salts are arranged according to their chemical affinities; but their action on Drosera does not seem to be thus governed. The nature of the base is far more important, as far as can be judged from the few experiments here given, than that of the acid; and this is the conclusion at which physiologists have arrived with respect to animals. We see this fact illustrated in all the nine salts of soda causing inflection, and in not being poisonous except when given in large doses; whereas seven of [page 187] the corresponding salts of potash do not cause inflection, and some of them are poisonous. Two of them, however, viz. the oxalate and iodide of potash, slowly induced a slight and rather doubtful amount of inflection. This difference between the two series is interesting, as Dr. Burdon Sanderson informs me that sodium salts may be introduced in large doses into the circulation of mammals without any injurious effects; whilst small doses of potassium salts cause death by suddenly arresting the movements of the heart. An excellent instance of the different action of the two series is presented by the phosphate of soda quickly causing vigorous inflection, whilst phosphate of potash is quite inefficient. The great power of the former is probably due to the presence of phosphorus, as in the cases of phosphate of lime and of ammonia. Hence we may infer that Drosera cannot obtain phosphorus from the phosphate of potash. This is remarkable, as I hear from Dr. Burdon Sanderson that phosphate of potash is certainly decomposed within the bodies of animals. Most of the salts of soda act very rapidly; the iodide acting slowest. The oxalate, nitrate, and citrate seem to have a special tendency to cause the blade of the leaf to be inflected. The glands of the disc, after absorbing the citrate, transmit hardly any motor impulse to the outer tentacles; and in this character the citrate of soda resembles the citrate of ammonia, or a decoction of grass-leaves; these three fluids all acting chiefly on the blade. It seems opposed to the rule of the preponderant influence of the base that the nitrate of lithium causes moderately rapid inflection, whereas the acetate causes none; but this metal is closely allied to sodium [page 188] and potassium,* which act so differently; therefore we might expect that its action would be intermediate. We see, also, that caesium causes inflection, and rubidium does not; and these two metals are allied to sodium and potassium. Most of the earthy salts are inoperative. Two salts of calcium, four of magnesium, two of barium, and two of strontium, did not cause any inflection, and thus follow the rule of the preponderant power of the base. Of three salts of aluminium, one did not act, a second showed a trace of action, and the third acted slowly and doubtfully, so that their effects are nearly alike. Of the salts and acids of ordinary metals, seventeen were tried, and only four, namely those of zinc, lead, manganese, and cobalt, failed to cause inflection. The salts of cadmium, tin, antimony, and iron, act slowly; and the three latter seem more or less poisonous. The salts of silver, mercury, gold, copper, nickel, and platinum, chromic and arsenious acids, cause great inflection with extreme quickness, and are deadly poisons. It is surprising, judging from animals, that lead and barium should not be poisonous. Most of the poisonous salts make the glands black, but chloride of platinum made them very pale. I shall have occasion, in the next chapter, to add a few remarks on the different effects of phosphate of ammonia on leaves previously immersed in various solutions. ACIDS. I will first give, as in the case of the salts, a list of the twenty-four acids which were tried, divided into two series, according as they cause or do not cause * Miller’s ‘Elements of Chemistry,’ 3rd edit. pp. 337, 448. [page 189] inflection. After describing the experiments, a few concluding remarks will be added. ACIDS, MUCH DILUTED, WHICH CAUSE INFLECTION. 1. Nitric, strong inflection; poisonous. 2. Hydrochloric, moderate and slow inflection; not poisonous. 3. Hydriodic, strong inflection; poisonous. 4. Iodic, strong inflection; poisonous. 5. Sulphuric, strong inflection; somewhat poisonous. 6. Phosphoric, strong inflection; poisonous. 7. Boracic; moderate and rather slow inflection; not poisonous. 8. Formic, very slight inflection; not poisonous. 9. Acetic, strong and rapid inflection; poisonous. 10. Propionic, strong but not very rapid inflection; poisonous. 11. Oleic, quick inflection; very poisonous. 12. Carbolic, very slow inflection; poisonous. 13. Lactic, slow and moderate inflection; poisonous. 14. Oxalic, moderately quick inflection; very poisonous. 15.

Tannic; not poisonous. 3. Tartaric; not poisonous. 4. Citric; not poisonous. 5. Uric; (?) not poisonous. Nitric Acid.—Four leaves were placed, each in thirty minims of one part by weight of the acid to 437 of water, so that each received 1/16 of a grain, or 4.048 mg. This strength was chosen for this and most of the following experiments, as it is the same [page 190] as that of most of the foregoing saline solutions. In 2 hrs. 30 m. some of the leaves were considerably, and in 6 hrs. 30 m. all were immensely, inflected, as were their blades. The surrounding fluid was slightly coloured pink, which always shows that the leaves have been injured. They were then left in water for three days; but they remained inflected and were evidently killed. Most of the glands had become colourless. Two leaves were then immersed, each in thirty minims of one part to 1000 of water; in a few hours there was some inflection; and after 24 hrs. both leaves had almost all their tentacles and blades inflected; they were left in water for three days, and one partially re-expanded and recovered. Two leaves were next immersed, each in thirty minims of one part to 2000 of water; this produced very little effect, except that most of the tentacles close to the summit of the petiole were inflected, as if the acid had been absorbed by the cut-off end. Hydrochloric Acid.—One part to 437 of water; four leaves were immersed as before, each in thirty minims. After 6 hrs. only one leaf was considerably inflected. After 8 hrs. 15 m. one had its tentacles and blade well inflected; the other three were moderately inflected, and the blade of one slightly. The surrounding fluid was not coloured at all pink. After 25 hrs. three of these four leaves began to re-expand, but their glands were of a pink instead of a red colour; after two more days they fully re-expanded; but the fourth leaf remained inflected, and seemed much injured or killed, with its glands white. Four leaves were then treated, each with thirty minims of one part to 875 of water; after 21 hrs. they were moderately inflected; and on being transferred to water, fully re-expanded in two days, and seemed quite healthy. Hydriodic Acid.—One to 437 of water; three leaves were immersed as before, each in thirty minims. After 45 m. the glands were discoloured, and the surrounding fluid became pinkish, but there was no inflection. After 5 hrs. all the tentacles were closely inflected; and an immense amount of mucus was secreted, so that the fluid could be drawn out into long ropes. The leaves were then placed in water, but never re-expanded, and were evidently killed. Four leaves were next immersed in one part to 875 of water; the action was now slower, but after 22 hrs. all four leaves were closely inflected, and were affected in other respects as above described. These leaves did not re-expand, though left for four days in water. This acid acts far more powerfully than hydrochloric, and is poisonous. Iodic Acid.—One to 437 of water; three leaves were immersed, [page 191] each in thirty minims; after 3 hrs. strong inflection; after 4 hrs. glands dark brown; after 8 hrs. 30 m. close inflection, and the leaves had become flaccid; surrounding fluid not coloured pink. These leaves were then placed in water, and next day were evidently dead. Sulphuric Acid.—One to 437 of water; four leaves were immersed, each in thirty minims; after 4 hrs. great inflection; after 6 hrs. surrounding fluid just tinged pink; they were then placed in water, and after 46 hrs. two of them were still closely inflected, two beginning to re-expand; many of the glands colourless. This acid is not so poisonous as hydriodic or iodic acids. Phosphoric Acid.—One to 437 of water; three leaves were immersed together in ninety minims; after 5 hrs. 30 m. some inflection, and some glands colourless; after 8 hrs. all the tentacles closely inflected, and many glands colourless; surrounding fluid pink. Left in water for two days and a half, remained in the same state and appeared dead. Boracic Acid.—One to 437 of water; four leaves were immersed together in 120 minims; after 6 hrs. very slight inflection; after 8 hrs. 15 m. two were considerably inflected, the other two slightly. After 24 hrs. one leaf was rather closely inflected, the second less closely, the third and fourth moderately. The leaves were washed and put into water; after 24 hrs. they were almost fully re-expanded and looked healthy. This acid agrees closely with hydrochloric acid of the same strength in its power of causing inflection, and in not being poisonous. Formic Acid.—Four leaves were immersed together in 120 minims of one part to 437 of water; after 40 m. slight, and after 6 hrs. 30 m. very moderate inflection; after 22 hrs. only a little more inflection than often occurs in water. Two of the leaves were then washed and placed in a solution (1 gr. to 20 oz.) of phosphate of ammonia; after 24 hrs. they were considerably inflected, with the contents of their cells aggregated, showing that the phosphate had acted, though not to the full and ordinary degree. Acetic Acid.—Four leaves were immersed together in 120 minims of one part to 437 of water. In 1 hr. 20 m. the tentacles of all four and the blades of two were greatly inflected. After 8 hrs. the leaves had become flaccid, but still remained closely inflected, the surrounding fluid being coloured pink. They were then washed and placed in water; next morning they were still inflected and of a very dark red colour, but with their glands colourless. After another day they were dingy-coloured, and [page 192] evidently dead. This acid is far more powerful than formic, and is highly poisonous. Half-minim drops of a stronger mixture (viz. one part by measure to 320 of water) were placed on the discs of five leaves; none of the exterior tentacles, only those on the borders of the disc which actually absorbed the acid, became inflected. Probably the dose was too strong and paralysed the leaves, for drops of a weaker mixture caused much inflection; nevertheless the leaves all died after two days. Propionic Acid.—Three leaves were immersed in ninety minims of a mixture of one part to 437 of water; in 1 hr. 50 m. there was no inflection; but after 3 hrs. 40 m. one leaf was greatly inflected, and the other two slightly. The inflection continued to increase, so that in 8 hrs. all three leaves were closely inflected. Next morning, after 20 hrs., most of the glands were very pale, but some few were almost black. No mucus had been secreted, and the surrounding fluid was only just perceptibly tinted of a pale pink. After 46 hrs. the leaves became slightly flaccid and were evidently killed, as was afterwards proved to be the case by keeping them in water. The protoplasm in the closely inflected tentacles was not in the least aggregated, but towards their bases it was collected in little brownish masses at the bottoms of the cells. This protoplasm was dead, for on leaving the leaf in a solution of carbonate of ammonia, no aggregation ensued. Propionic acid is highly poisonous to Drosera, like its ally acetic acid, but induces inflection at a much slower rate. Oleic Acid (given me by Prof. Frankland).—Three leaves were immersed in this acid; some inflection was almost immediately caused, which increased slightly, but then ceased, and the leaves seemed killed. Next morning they were rather shrivelled, and many of the glands had fallen off the tentacles. Drops of this acid were placed on the discs of four leaves; in 40 m. all the tentacles were greatly inflected, excepting the extreme marginal ones; and many of these after 3 hrs. became inflected. I was led to try this acid from supposing that it was present (which does not seem to be the case)* in olive oil, the action of which is anomalous. Thus drops of this oil placed on the disc do not cause the outer tentacles to be inflected; yet when minute drops were added to the secretion surrounding the glands of the outer tentacles, these were occasionally, but by no means always, inflected. Two leaves were also immersed in this oil, and there * See articles on Glycerine and Oleic Acid in Watts’ ‘Dict. of Chemistry.’ [page 193] was no inflection for about 12 hrs.; but after 23 hrs. almost all the tentacles were inflected. Three leaves were likewise immersed in unboiled linseed oil, and soon became somewhat, and in 3 hrs. greatly, inflected. After 1 hr. the secretion round the glands was coloured pink. I infer from this latter fact that the power of linseed oil to cause inflection cannot be attributed to the albumin which it is said to contain. Carbolic Acid.—Two leaves were immersed in sixty minims of a solution of 1 gr. to 437 of water; in 7 hrs. one was slightly, and in 24 hrs. both were closely, inflected, with a surprising amount of mucus secreted. These leaves were washed and left for two days in water; they remained inflected; most of their glands became pale, and they seemed dead. This acid is poisonous, but does not act nearly so rapidly or powerfully as might have been expected from its known destructive power on the lowest organisms. Half-minims of the same solution were placed on the discs of three leaves; after 24 hrs. no inflection of the outer tentacles ensued, and when bits of meat were given them, they became fairly well inflected. Again half-minims of a stronger solution, of one part to 218 of water, were placed on the discs of three leaves; no inflection of the outer tentacles ensued; bits of meat were then given as before; one leaf alone became well inflected, the discal glands of the other two appearing much injured and dry. We thus see that the glands of the discs, after absorbing this acid, rarely transmit any motor impulse to the outer tentacles; though these, when their own glands absorb the acid, are strongly acted on. Lactic Acid.—Three leaves were immersed in ninety minims of one part to 437 of water. After 48 m. there was no inflection, but the surrounding fluid was coloured pink; after 8 hrs. 30 m. one leaf alone was a little inflected, and almost all the glands on all three leaves were of a very pale colour. The leaves were then washed and placed in a solution (1 gr. to 20 oz.) of phosphate of ammonia; after about 16 hrs. there was only a trace of inflection. They were left in the phosphate for 48 hrs., and remained in the same state, with almost all their glands discoloured. The protoplasm within the cells was not aggregated, except in a very few tentacles, the glands of which were not much discoloured. I believe, therefore, that almost all the glands and tentacles had been killed by the acid so suddenly that hardly any inflection was caused. Four leaves were next immersed in 120 minims of a weaker solution, of one part to 875 of water; after 2 hrs. 30 m. the surrounding fluid was quite pink; the glands were pale, but [page 194] there was no inflection; after 7 hrs. 30 m. two of the leaves showed some inflection, and the glands were almost white; after 21 hrs. two of the leaves were considerably inflected, and a third slightly; most of the glands were white, the others dark red. After 45 hrs. one leaf had almost every tentacle inflected; a second a large number; the third and fourth very few; almost all the glands were white, excepting those on the discs of two of the leaves, and many of these were very dark red. The leaves appeared dead. Hence lactic acid acts in a very peculiar manner, causing inflection at an extraordinarily slow rate, and being highly poisonous. Immersion in even weaker solutions, viz. of one part to 1312 and 1750 of water, apparently killed the leaves (the tentacles after a time being bowed backwards), and rendered the glands white, but caused no inflection. Gallic, Tannic, Tartaric, and Citric Acids.—One part to 437 of water. Three or four leaves were immersed, each in thirty minims of these four solutions, so that each leaf received 1/16 of a grain, or 4.048 mg. No inflection was caused in 24 hrs., and the leaves did not appear at all injured. Those which had been in the tannic and tartaric acids were placed in a solution (1 gr. to 20 oz.) of phosphate of ammonia, but no inflection ensued in 24 hrs. On the other hand, the four leaves which had been in the citric acid, when treated with the phosphate, became decidedly inflected in 50 m. and strongly inflected after 5 hrs., and so remained for the next 24 hrs. Malic Acid.—Three leaves were immersed in ninety minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water; no inflection was caused in 8 hrs. 20 m., but after 24 hrs. two of them were considerably, and the third slightly, inflected—more so than could be accounted for by the action of water. No great amount of mucus was secreted. They were then placed in water, and after two days partially re-expanded. Hence this acid is not poisonous. Oxalic Acid.—Three leaves were immersed in ninety minims of a solution of 1 gr. to 437 of water; after 2 hrs. 10 m. there was much inflection; glands pale; the surrounding fluid of a dark pink colour; after 8 hrs. excessive inflection. The leaves were then placed in water; after about 16 hrs. the tentacles were of a very dark red colour, like those of the leaves in acetic acid. After 24 additional hours, the three leaves were dead and their glands colourless. Benzoic Acid.—Five leaves were immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of 1 gr. to 437 of water. This solution was so weak that it only just tasted acid, yet, as we shall see, was highly poisonous to Drosera. After 52 m. the submarginal [page 195] tentacles were somewhat inflected, and all the glands very pale-coloured; the surrounding fluid was coloured pink. On one occasion the fluid became pink in the course of only 12 m., and the glands as white as if the leaf had been dipped in boiling water. After 4 hrs. much inflection; but none of the tentacles were closely inflected, owing, as I believe, to their having been paralysed before they had time to complete their movement. An extraordinary quantity of mucus was secreted. Some of the leaves were left in the solution; others, after an immersion of 6 hrs. 30 m., were placed in water. Next morning both lots were quite dead; the leaves in the solution being flaccid, those in the water (now coloured yellow) of a pale brown tint, and their glands white. Succinic Acid.—Three leaves were immersed in ninety minims of a solution of 1 gr. to 437 of water; after 4 hrs. 15 m. considerable and after 23 hrs. great inflection; many of the glands pale; fluid coloured pink. The leaves were then washed and placed in water; after two days there was some re-expansion, but many of the glands were still white. This acid is not nearly so poisonous as oxalic or benzoic. Uric Acid.—Three leaves were immersed in 180 minims of a solution of 1 gr. to 875 of warm water, but all the acid was not dissolved; so that each received nearly 1/16 of a grain. After 25 m. there was some slight inflection, but this never increased; after 9 hrs. the glands were not discoloured, nor was the solution coloured pink; nevertheless much mucus was secreted. The leaves were then placed in water, and by next morning fully re-expanded. I doubt whether this acid really causes inflection, for the slight movement which at first occurred may have been due to the presence of a trace of albuminous matter. But it produces some effect, as shown by the secretion of so much mucus. Hippuric Acid.—Four leaves were immersed in 120 minims of a solution of 1 gr. to 437 of water. After 2 hrs. the fluid was coloured pink; glands pale, but no inflection. After 6 hrs. some inflection; after 9 hrs. all four leaves greatly inflected; much mucus secreted; all the glands very pale. The leaves were then left in water for two days; they remained closely inflected, with their glands colourless, and I do not doubt were killed. Hydrocyanic Acid.—Four leaves were immersed, each in thirty minims of one part to 437 of water; in 2 hrs. 45 m. all the tentacles were considerably inflected, with many of the glands pale; after 3 hrs. 45 m. all strongly inflected, and the surrounding fluid coloured pink; after 6 hrs. all closely inflected. After [page 196] an immersion of 8 hrs. 20 m. the leaves were washed and placed in water; next morning, after about 16 hrs., they were still inflected and discoloured; on the succeeding day they were evidently dead. Two leaves were immersed in a stronger mixture, of one part to fifty of water; in 1 hr. 15 m. the glands became as white as porcelain, as if they had been dipped in boiling water; very few of the tentacles were inflected; but after 4 hrs. almost all were inflected. These leaves were then placed in water, and next morning were evidently dead. Half-minim drops of the same strength (viz. one part to fifty of water) were next placed on the discs of five leaves; after 21 hrs. all the outer tentacles were inflected, and the leaves appeared much injured. I likewise touched the secretion round a large number of glands with minute drops (about 1/20 of a minim, or .00296 ml.) of Scheele’s mixture (6 per cent.); the glands first became bright red, and after 3 hrs. 15 m. about two-thirds of the tentacles bearing these glands were inflected, and remained so for the two succeeding days, when they appeared dead.] Concluding Remarks on the Action of Acids.—It is evident that acids have a strong tendency to cause the inflection of the tentacles;* for out of the twenty-four acids tried, nineteen thus acted, either rapidly and energetically, or slowly and slightly. This fact is remarkable, as the juices of many plants contain more acid, judging by the taste, than the solutions employed in my experiments. From the powerful effects of so many acids on Drosera, we are led to infer that those naturally contained in the tissues of this plant, as well as of others, must play some important part in their economy. Of the five cases in which acids did not cause the tentacles to be inflected, one is doubtful; for uric acid did act slightly, and caused a copious secretion of mucus. Mere sourness to the taste is no * According to M. Fournier (‘De la Fcondation dans les Phanrogames.’ 1863, p. 61) drops of acetic, hydrocyanic, and sulphuric acid cause the stamens of Berberis instantly to close; though drops of water have no such power, which latter statement I can confirm; [page 197] criterion of the power of an acid on Drosera, as citric and tartaric acids are very sour, yet do not excite inflection. It is remarkable how acids differ in their power. Thus, hydrochloric acid acts far less powerfully than hydriodic and many other acids of the same strength, and is not poisonous. This is an interesting fact, as hydrochloric acid plays so important a part in the digestive process of animals. Formic acid induces very slight inflection, and is not poisonous; whereas its ally, acetic acid, acts rapidly and powerfully, and is poisonous. Malic acid acts slightly, whereas citric and tartaric acids produce no effect. Lactic acid is poisonous, and is remarkable from inducing inflection only after a considerable interval of time. Nothing surprised me more than that a solution of benzoic acid, so weak as to be hardly acidulous to the taste, should act with great rapidity and be highly poisonous; for I am informed that it produces no marked effect on the animal economy. It may be seen, by looking down the list at the head of this discussion, that most of the acids are poisonous, often highly so. Diluted acids are known to induce negative osmose,* and the poisonous action of so many acids on Drosera is, perhaps, connected with this power, for we have seen that the fluids in which they were immersed often became pink, and the glands pale-coloured or white. Many of the poisonous acids, such as hydriodic, benzoic, hippuric, and carbolic (but I neglected to record all the cases), caused the secretion of an extraordinary amount of mucus, so that long ropes of this matter hung from the leaves when they were lifted out of the solutions. Other acids, such as hydrochloric and malic, have no such ten- * Miller’s ‘Elements of Chemistry,’ part i. 1867, p. 87. [page 198] dency; in these two latter cases the surrounding fluid was not coloured pink, and the leaves were not poisoned. On the other hand, propionic acid, which is poisonous, does not cause much mucus to be secreted, yet the surrounding fluid became slightly pink. Lastly, as in the case of saline solutions, leaves, after being immersed in certain acids, were soon acted on by phosphate of ammonia; on the other hand, they were not thus affected after immersion in certain other acids. To this subject, however, I shall have to recur. [page 199] ',\n",

As in the last chapter, I will first give my experiments, and then a brief summary of the results with some concluding remarks. [Acetate of Strychnine.—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water were placed on the discs of six leaves; so that each received 1/960 of a grain, or .0675 mg. In 2 hrs. 30 m. the outer tentacles on some of them were inflected, but in an irregular manner, sometimes only on one side of the leaf. The next morning, after 22 hrs. 30 m. the inflection had not increased. The glands on the central disc were blackened, and had ceased secreting. After an additional 24 hrs. all the central glands seemed dead, but the inflected tentacles had re-expanded and appeared quite healthy. Hence the poisonous action of strychnine seems confined to the glands which have absorbed it; nevertheless, these glands transmit a motor impulse to the exterior tentacles. Minute drops (about 1/20 of a minim) of the same solution applied to the glands of the outer tentacles occasionally caused them to bend. The poison does not seem to act quickly, for having applied to several glands similar drops of a rather stronger solution, of one part to 292 of water, this did not prevent the tentacles bending, when their glands [page 200] were excited, after an interval of a quarter to three quarters of an hour, by being rubbed or given bits of meat. Similar drops of a solution of one part to 218 of water (2 grs. to 1 oz.) quickly blackened the glands; some few tentacles thus treated moved, whilst others did not. The latter, however, on being subsequently moistened with saliva or given bits of meat, became incurved, though with extreme slowness; and this shows that they had been injured. Stronger solutions (but the strength was not ascertained) sometimes arrested all power of movement very quickly; thus bits of meat were placed on the glands of several exterior tentacles, and as soon as they began to move, minute drops of the strong solution were added. They continued for a short time to go on bending, and then suddenly stood still; other tentacles on the same leaves, with meat on their glands, but not wetted with the strychnine, continued to bend and soon reached the centre of the leaf. Citrate of Strychnine.—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water were placed on the discs of six leaves; after 24 hrs. the outer tentacles showed only a trace of inflection. Bits of meat were then placed on three of these leaves, but in 24 hrs. only slight and irregular inflection occurred, proving that the leaves had been greatly injured. Two of the leaves to which meat had not been given had their discal glands dry and much injured. Minute drops of a strong solution of one part to 109 of water (4 grs. to 1 oz.) were added to the secretion round several glands, but did not produce nearly so plain an effect as the drops of a much weaker solution of the acetate. Particles of the dry citrate were placed on six glands; two of these moved some way towards the centre, and then stood still, being no doubt killed; three others curved much farther inwards, and were then fixed; one alone reached the centre. Five leaves were immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water; so that each received 1/16 of a grain; after about 1 hr. some of the outer tentacles became inflected, and the glands were oddly mottled with black and white. These glands, in from 4 hrs. to 5 hrs., became whitish and opaque, and the protoplasm in the cells of the tentacles was well aggregated. By this time two of the leaves were greatly inflected, but the three others not much more inflected than they were before. Nevertheless two fresh leaves, after an immersion respectively for 2 hrs. and 4 hrs. in the solution, were not killed; for on being left for 1 hr. 30 m. in a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 218 of water, their tentacles became more inflected, and there was much aggregation. The glands [page 201] of two other leaves, after an immersion for 2 hrs. in a stronger solution, of one part of the citrate to 218 of water, became of an opaque, pale pink colour, which before long disappeared, leaving them white. One of these two leaves had its blade and tentacles greatly inflected; the other hardly at all; but the protoplasm in the cells of both was aggregated down to the bases of the tentacles, with the spherical masses in the cells close beneath the glands blackened. After 24 hrs. one of these leaves was colourless, and evidently dead. Sulphate of Quinine.—Some of this salt was added to water, which is said to dissolve 1/1000 part of its weight. Five leaves were immersed, each in thirty minims of this solution, which tasted bitter. In less than 1 hr. some of them had a few tentacles inflected. In 3 hrs. most of the glands became whitish, others dark-coloured, and many oddly mottled. After 6 hrs. two of the leaves had a good many tentacles inflected, but this very moderate degree of inflection never increased. One of the leaves was taken out of the solution after 4 hrs., and placed in water; by the next morning some few of the inflected tentacles had re-expanded, showing that they were not dead; but the glands were still much discoloured. Another leaf not included in the above lot, after an immersion of 3 hrs. 15 m., was carefully examined; the protoplasm in the cells of the outer tentacles, and of the short green ones on the disc, had become strongly aggregated down to their bases; and I distinctly saw that the little masses changed their positions and shapes rather rapidly; some coalescing and again separating. I was surprised at this fact, because quinine is said to arrest all movement in the white corpuscles of the blood; but as, according to Binz,* this is due to their being no longer supplied with oxygen by the red corpuscles, any such arrestment of movement could not be expected in Drosera. That the glands had absorbed some of the salt was evident from their change of colour; but I at first thought that the solution might not have travelled down the cells of the tentacles, where the protoplasm was seen in active movement. This view, however, I have no doubt, is erroneous, for a leaf which had been immersed for 3 hrs. in the quinine solution was then placed in a little solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 218 of water; and in 30 m. the glands and the upper cells of the tentacles became intensely black, with the protoplasm presenting a very unusual appearance; for it * ‘Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science,’ April 1874, p. 185. [page 202] had become aggregated into reticulated dingy-coloured masses, having rounded and angular interspaces. As I have never seen this effect produced by the carbonate of ammonia alone, it must be attributed to the previous action of the quinine. These reticulated masses were watched for some time, but did not change their forms; so that the protoplasm no doubt had been killed by the combined action of the two salts, though exposed to them for only a short time. Another leaf, after an immersion for 24 hrs. in the quinine solution, became somewhat flaccid, and the protoplasm in all the cells was aggregated. Many of the aggregated masses were discoloured, and presented a granular appearance; they were spherical, or elongated, or still more commonly consisted of little curved chains of small globules. None of these masses exhibited the least movement, and no doubt were all dead. Half-minims of the solution were placed on the discs of six leaves; after 23 hrs. one had all its tentacles, two had a few, and the others none inflected; so that the discal glands, when irritated by this salt, do not transmit any strong motor impulse to the outer tentacles. After 48 hrs. the glands on the discs of all six leaves were evidently much injured or quite killed. It is clear that this salt is highly poisonous.* Acetate of Quinine.—Four leaves were immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water. The solution was tested with litmus paper, and was not acid. After only 10 m. all four leaves were greatly, and after 6 hrs. immensely, inflected. They were then left in water for 60 hrs., but never re-expanded; the glands were white, and the leaves evidently dead. This salt is far more efficient than the sulphate in causing inflection, and, like that salt, is highly poisonous. Nitrate of Quinine.—Four leaves were immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water. After 6 hrs. there was hardly a trace of inflection; after 22 hrs. three of the leaves were moderately, and the fourth slightly inflected; so that this salt induces, though rather slowly, well-marked inflection. These leaves, on being left in water for 48 hrs., almost *Binz found several years ago (as stated in ‘The Journal of Anatomy and Phys.’ November 1872, p. 195) that quinia is an energetic poison to low vegetable and animal organisms. Even one part added to 4000 parts of blood arrests the movements of the white corpuscles, which become “rounded and granular.” In the tentacles of Drosera the aggregated masses of protoplasm, which appeared killed by the quinine, likewise presented a granular appearance. A similar appearance is caused by very hot water. [page 203] completely re-expanded, but the glands were much discoloured. Hence this salt is not poisonous in any high degree. The different action of the three foregoing salts of quinine is singular. Digitaline.—Half-minims of a solution of one part to 437 of water were placed on the discs of five leaves. In 3 hrs. 45 m. Some of them had their tentacles, and one had its blade, moderately inflected. After 8 hrs. three of them were well inflected; the fourth had only a few tentacles inflected, and the fifth (an old leaf) was not at all affected. They remained in nearly the same state for two days, but the glands on their discs became pale. On the third day the leaves appeared much injured. Nevertheless, when bits of meat were placed on two of them, the outer tentacles became inflected. A minute drop (about 1/20 of a minim) of the solution was applied to three glands, and after 6 hrs. all three tentacles were inflected, but next day had nearly re-expanded; so that this very small dose of 1/28800 of a grain (.00225 mg.) acts on a tentacle, but is not poisonous. It appears from these several facts that digitaline causes inflection, and poisons the glands which absorb a moderately large amount. Nicotine.—The secretion round several glands was touched with a minute drop of the pure fluid, and the glands were instantly blackened; the tentacles becoming inflected in a few minutes. Two leaves were immersed in a weak solution of two drops to 1 oz., or 437 grains, of water. When examined after 3 hrs. 20 m., only twenty-one tentacles on one leaf were closely inflected, and six on the other slightly so; but all the glands were blackened, or very dark-coloured, with the protoplasm in all the cells of all the tentacles much aggregated and dark-coloured. The leaves were not quite killed, for on being placed in a little solution of carbonate of ammonia (2 grs. to 1 oz.) a few more tentacles became inflected, the remainder not being acted on during the next 24 hrs. Half-minims of a stronger solution (two drops to 1/2 oz. of water) were placed on the discs of six leaves, and in 30 m. all those tentacles became inflected; the glands of which had actually touched the solution, as shown by their blackness; but hardly any motor influence was transmitted to the outer tentacles. After 22 hrs. most of the glands on the discs appeared dead; but this could not have been the case, as when bits of meat were placed on three of them, some few of the outer tentacles were inflected in 24 hrs. Hence nicotine has a great tendency to blacken the glands and to induce aggregation [page 204] of the protoplasm, but, except when pure, has very moderate power of inducing inflection, and still less power of causing a motor influence to be transmitted from the discal glands to the outer tentacles. It is moderately poisonous. Atropine.—A grain was added to 437 grains of water, but was not all dissolved; another grain was added to 437 grains of a mixture of one part of alcohol to seven parts of water; and a third solution was made by adding one part of valerianate of atropine to 437 of water. Half-minims of these three solutions were placed, in each case, on the discs of six leaves; but no effect whatever was produced, excepting that the glands on the discs to which the valerianate was given were slightly discoloured. The six leaves on which drops of the solution of atropine in diluted alcohol had been left for 21 hrs. were given bits of meat, and all became in 24 hrs. fairly well inflected; so that atropine does not excite movement, and is not poisonous. I also tried in the same manner the alkaloid sold as daturine, which is believed not to differ from atropine, and it produced no effect. Three of the leaves on which drops of this latter solution had been left for 24 hrs. were likewise given bits of meat, and they had in the course of 24 hrs. a good many of their submarginal tentacles inflected. Veratrine, Colchicine, Theine.—Solutions were made of these three alkaloids by adding one part to 437 of water. Half-minims were placed, in each case; on the discs of at least six leaves, but no inflection was caused, except perhaps a very slight amount by the theine. Half-minims of a strong infusion of tea likewise produced, as formerly stated, no effect. I also tried similar drops of an infusion of one part of the extract of colchicum, sold by druggists, to 218 of water; and the leaves were observed for 48 hrs., without any effect being produced. The seven leaves on which drops of veratrine had been left for 26 hrs. were given bits of meat, and after 21 hrs. were well inflected. These three alkaloids are therefore quite innocuous. Curare.—One part of this famous poison was added to 218 of water, and three leaves were immersed in ninety minims of the filtered solution. In 3 hrs. 30 m. some of the tentacles were a little inflected; as was the blade of one; after 4 hrs. After 7 hrs. the glands were wonderfully blackened, showing that matter of some kind had been absorbed. In 9 hrs. two of the leaves had most of their tentacles sub-inflected, but the inflection did not increase in the course of 24 hrs. One of these leaves, after being immersed for 9 hrs. in the solution, was placed in water, and by next morning had largely re-expanded; [page 205] the other two, after their immersion for 24 hrs., were likewise placed in water, and in 24 hrs. were considerably re-expanded, though their glands were as black as ever. Half-minims were placed on the discs of six leaves, and no inflection ensued; but after three days the glands on the discs appeared rather dry, yet to my surprise were not blackened. On another occasion drops were placed on the discs of six leaves, and a considerable amount of inflection was soon caused; but as I had not filtered the solution, floating particles may have acted on the glands. After 24 hrs. bits of meat were placed on the discs of three of these leaves, and next day they became strongly inflected. As I at first thought that the poison might not have been dissolved in pure water, one grain was added to 437 grains of a mixture of one part of alcohol to seven of water, and half-minims were placed on the discs of six leaves. These were not at all affected, and when after a day bits of meat were given them, they were slightly inflected in 5 hrs., and closely after 24 hrs. It follows from these several facts that a solution of curare induces a very moderate degree of inflection, and this may perhaps be due to the presence of a minute quantity of albumen. It certainly is not poisonous. The protoplasm in one of the leaves, which had been immersed for 24 hrs., and which had become slightly inflected, had undergone a very slight amount of aggregation—not more than often ensues from an immersion of this length of time in water. Acetate of Morphia.—I tried a great number of experiments with this substance, but with no certain result. A considerable number of leaves were immersed from between 2 hrs. and 6 hrs. in a solution of one part to 218 of water, and did not become inflected. Nor were they poisoned; for when they were washed and placed in weak solutions of phosphate and carbonate of ammonia, they soon became strongly inflected, with the protoplasm in the cells well aggregated. If, however, whilst the leaves were immersed in the morphia, phosphate of ammonia was added, inflection did not rapidly ensue. Minute drops of the solution were applied in the usual manner to the secretion round between thirty and forty glands; and when, after an interval of 6 m:, bits of meat, a little saliva, or particles of glass, were placed on them, the movement of the tentacles was greatly retarded. But on other occasions no such retardation occurred. Drops of water similarly applied never have any retarding power. Minute drops of a solution of sugar of the same strength (one part to 218 of water) sometimes retarded the subsequent action of meat and of particles of glass, and [page 206] sometimes did not do so. At one time I felt convinced that morphia acted as a narcotic on Drosera, but after having found in what a singular manner immersion in certain non-poisonous salts and acids prevents the subsequent action of phosphate of ammonia, whereas other solutions have no such power, my first conviction seems very doubtful. Extract of Hyoscyamus.—Several leaves were placed, each in thirty minims of an infusion of 3 grs. of the extract sold by druggists to 1 oz. of water. One of them, after being immersed for 5 hrs. 15 m., was not inflected, and was then put into a solution (1 gr. to 1 oz.) of carbonate of ammonia; after 2 hrs. 40 m. it was found considerably inflected, and the glands much blackened. Four of the leaves, after being immersed for 2 hrs. 14 m., were placed in 120 minims of a solution (1 gr. to 20 oz.) of phosphate of ammonia; they had already become slightly inflected from the hyoscyamus, probably owing to the presence of some albuminous matter, as formerly explained, but the inflection immediately increased, and after 1 hr. was strongly pronounced; so that hyoscyamus does not act as a narcotic or poison. Poison from the Fang of a Living Adder.—Minute drops were placed on the glands of many tentacles; these were quickly inflected, just as if saliva had been given them, Next morning, after 17 hrs. 30 m., all were beginning to re-expand, and they appeared uninjured. Poison from the Cobra.—Dr. Fayrer, well known from his investigations on the poison of this deadly snake, was so kind as to give me some in a dried state. It is an albuminous substance, and is believed to replace the ptyaline of saliva.* A minute drop (about 1/20 of a minim) of a solution of one part to 437 of water was applied to the secretion round four glands; so that each received only about 1/38400 of a grain (.0016 mg.). The operation was repeated on four other glands; and in 15 m. several of the eight tentacles became well inflected, and all of them in 2 hrs. Next morning, after 24 hrs., they were still inflected, and the glands of a very pale pink colour. After an additional 24 hrs. they were nearly re-expanded, and completely so on the succeeding day; but most of the glands remained almost white. Half-minims of the same solution were placed on the discs of three leaves, so that each received 1/960 of a grain (.0675 mg.); in *Dr. Fayrer, ‘The Thanatophidia of India,’ 1872, p. 150. [page 207] 4 hrs. 15 m. the outer tentacles were much inflected; and after 6 hrs. 30 m. those on two of the leaves were closely inflected and the blade of one; the third leaf was only moderately affected. The leaves remained in the same state during the next day, but after 48 hrs. re-expanded. Three leaves were now immersed, each in thirty minims of the solution, so that each received 1/16 of a grain, or 4.048 mg. In 6 m. there was some inflection, which steadily increased, so that after 2 hrs. 30 m. all three leaves were closely inflected; the glands were at first somewhat darkened, then rendered pale; and the protoplasm within the cells of the tentacles was partially aggregated. The little masses of protoplasm were examined after 3 hrs., and again after 7 hrs., and on no other occasion have I seen them undergoing such rapid changes of form. After 8 hrs. 30 m. the glands had become quite white; they had not secreted any great quantity of mucus. The leaves were now placed in water, and after 40 hrs. re-expanded, showing that they were not much or at all injured. During their immersion in water the protoplasm within the cells of the tentacles was occasionally examined, and always found in strong movement. Two leaves were next immersed, each in thirty minims of a much stronger solution, of one part to 109 of water; so that each received 1/4 of a grain, or 16.2 mg; After 1 hr. 45 m. the sub-marginal tentacles were strongly inflected, with the glands somewhat pale; after 3 hrs. 30 m. both leaves had all their tentacles closely inflected and the glands white. Hence the weaker solution, as in so many other cases, induced more rapid inflection than the stronger one; but the glands were sooner rendered white by the latter. After an immersion of 24 hrs. some of the tentacles were examined, and the protoplasm, still of a fine purple colour, was found aggregated into chains of small globular masses. These changed their shapes with remarkable quickness. After an immersion of 48 hrs. they were again examined, and their movements were so plain that they could easily be seen under a weak power. The leaves were now placed in water, and after 24 hrs. (i.e. 72 hrs. from their first immersion) the little masses of protoplasm, which had become of a dingy purple, were still in strong movement, changing their shapes, coalescing, and again separating. In 8 hrs. after these two leaves had been placed in water (i.e. in 56 hrs. after their immersion in the solution) they began to re-expand, and by the next morning were more expanded. After an additional day (i.e. on the fourth day after their immersion in the solution) they were largely, but not quite fully [page 208] expanded. The tentacles were now examined, and the aggregated masses were almost wholly redissolved; the cells being filled with homogeneous purple fluid, with the exception here and there of a single globular mass. We thus see how completely the protoplasm had escaped all injury from the poison. As the glands were soon rendered quite white, it occurred to me that their texture might have been modified in such a manner as to prevent the poison passing into the cells beneath, and consequently that the protoplasm within these cells had not been at all affected. Accordingly I placed another leaf, which had been immersed for 48 hrs. in the poison and afterwards for 24 hrs. in water, in a little solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 218 of water; in 30 m. the protoplasm in the cells beneath the glands became darker, and in the course of 24 hrs. the tentacles were filled down to their bases with dark-coloured spherical masses. Hence the glands had not lost their power of absorption, as far as the carbonate of ammonia is concerned. From these facts it is manifest that the poison of the cobra, though so deadly to animals, is not at all poisonous to Drosera; yet it causes strong and rapid inflection of the tentacles, and soon discharges all colour from the glands. It seems even to act as a stimulant to the protoplasm, for after considerable experience in observing the movements of this substance in Drosera, I have never seen it on any other occasion in so active a state. I was therefore anxious to learn how this poison affected animal protoplasm; and Dr. Fayrer was so kind as to make some observations for me, which he has since published.* Ciliated epithelium from the mouth of a frog was placed in a solution of .03 gramme to 4.6 cubic cm. of water; others being placed at the same time in pure water for comparison. The movements of the cilia in the solution seemed at first increased, but soon languished, and after between 15 and 20 minutes ceased; whilst those in the water were still acting vigorously. The white corpuscles of the blood of a frog, and the cilia on two infusorial animals, a Paramaecium and Volvox, were similarly affected by the poison. Dr. Fayrer also found that the muscle of a frog lost its irritability after an immersion of 20 m. in the solution, not then responding to a strong electrical current. On the other hand, the movements of the cilia on the mantle of an Unio were not always arrested, even when left for a consider- * ‘Proceedings of Royal Society,’ Feb. 18, 1875. [page 209] able time in a very strong solution. On the whole, it seems that the poison of the cobra acts far more injuriously on the protoplasm of the higher animals than on that of Drosera. There is one other point which may be noticed. I have occasionally observed that the drops of secretion round the glands were rendered somewhat turbid by certain solutions, and more especially by some acids, a film being formed on the surfaces of the drops; but I never saw this effect produced in so conspicuous a manner as by the cobra poison. When the stronger solution was employed, the drops appeared in 10 m. like little white rounded clouds. After 48 hrs. the secretion was changed into threads and sheets of a membranous substance, including minute granules of various sizes. Camphor.—Some scraped camphor was left for a day in a bottle with distilled water, and then filtered. A solution thus made is said to contain 1/1000 of its weight of camphor; it smelt and tasted of this substance. Ten leaves were immersed in this solution; after 15 m. five of them were well inflected, two showing a first trace of movement in 11 m. and 12 m.; the sixth leaf did not begin to move until 15 m. had elapsed, but was fairly well inflected in 17 m. and quite closed in 24 m.; the seventh began to move in 17 m., and was completely shut in 26 m. The eighth, ninth, and tenth leaves were old and of a very dark red colour, and these were not inflected after an immersion of 24 hrs.; so that in making experiments with camphor it is necessary to avoid such leaves. Some of these leaves, on being left in the solution for 4 hrs., became of a rather dingy pink colour, and secreted much mucus; although their tentacles were closely inflected, the protoplasm within the cells was not at all aggregated. On another occasion, however, after a longer immersion of 24 hrs., there was well marked aggregation. A solution made by adding two drops of camphorated spirits to an ounce of water did not act on one leaf; whereas thirty minims added to an ounce of water acted on two leaves immersed together. M. Vogel has shown* that the flowers of various plants do not wither so soon when their stems are placed in a solution of camphor as when in water; and that if already slightly withered, they recover more quickly. The germination of certain seeds is also accelerated by the solution. So that camphor acts as a stimulant, and it is the only known stimulant for plants. I * ‘Gardener’s Chronicle,’ 1874, p. 671. Nearly similar observations were made in 1798 by B. S. Barton. [page 210] wished, therefore, to ascertain whether camphor would render the leaves of Drosera more sensitive to mechanical irritation than they naturally are. Six leaves were left in distilled water for 5 m. or 6 m., and then gently brushed twice or thrice, whilst still under water, with a soft camel-hair brush; but no movement ensued. Nine leaves, which had been immersed in the above solution of camphor for the times stated in the following table, were next brushed only once with the same brush and in the same manner as before; the results are given in the table. My first trials were made by brushing the leaves whilst still immersed in the solution; but it occurred to me that the viscid secretion round the glands would thus be removed, and the camphor might act more effectually on them. In all the following trials, therefore, each leaf was taken out of the solution, waved for about 15 s. in water, then placed in fresh water and brushed, so that the brushing would not allow the freer access of the camphor; but this treatment made no difference in the results.

Other leaves were left in the solution without being brushed; one of these first showed a trace of inflection after 11 m.; a second after 12 m.; five were not inflected until 15 m. had [page 211] elapsed, and two not until a few minutes later. On the other hand, it will be seen in the right-hand column of the table that most of the leaves subjected to the solution, and which were brushed, became inflected in a much shorter time. The movement of the tentacles of some of these leaves was so rapid that it could be plainly seen through a very weak lens. Two or three other experiments are worth giving. A large old leaf, after being immersed for 10 m. in the solution, did not appear likely to be soon inflected; so I brushed it, and in 2 m. it began to move, and in 3 m. was completely shut. Another leaf, after an immersion of 15 m., showed no signs of inflection, so was brushed, and in 4 m. was grandly inflected. A third leaf, after an immersion of 17 m., likewise showed no signs of inflection; it was then brushed, but did not move for 1 hr.; so that here was a failure. It was again brushed, and now in 9 m. a few tentacles became inflected; the failure therefore was not complete. We may conclude that a small dose of camphor in solution is a powerful stimulant to Drosera. It not only soon excites the tentacles to bend, but apparently renders the glands sensitive to a touch, which by itself does not cause any movement. Or it may be that a slight mechanical irritation not enough to cause any inflection yet gives some tendency to movement, and thus reinforces the action of the camphor. This latter view would have appeared to me the more probable one, had it not been shown by M. Vogel that camphor is a stimulant in other ways to various plants and seeds. Two plants bearing four or five leaves, and with their roots in a little cup of water, were exposed to the vapour of some bits of camphor (about as large as a filbert-nut), under a vessel holding ten fluid oz. After 10 hrs. no inflection ensued; but the glands appeared to be secreting more copiously. The leaves were in a narcotised condition, for on bits of meat being placed on two of them, there was no inflection in 3 hrs. 15 m., and even after 13 hrs. 15 m. only a few of the outer tentacles were slightly inflected; but this degree of movement shows that the leaves had not been killed by an exposure during 10 hrs. to the vapour of camphor. Oil of Caraway.—Water is said to dissolve about a thousandth part of its weight of this oil. A drop was added to an ounce of water and the bottle occasionally shaken during a day; but many minute globules remained undissolved. Five leaves were immersed in this mixture; in from 4 m. to 5 m. there was some inflection, which became moderately pronounced in two or [page 212] three additional minutes. After 14 m. all five leaves were well, and some of them closely, inflected. After 6 hrs. the glands were white, and much mucus had been secreted. The leaves were now flaccid, of a peculiar dull-red colour, and evidently dead. One of the leaves, after an immersion of 4 m., was brushed, like the leaves in the camphor, but this produced no effect. A plant with its roots in water was exposed under a 10-oz. vessel to the vapour of this oil, and in 1 hr. 20 m. one leaf showed a trace of inflection. After 5 hrs. 20 m. the cover was taken off and the leaves examined; one had all its tentacles closely inflected, the second about half in the same state; and the third all sub-inflected. The plant was left in the open air for 42 hrs., but not a single tentacle expanded; all the glands appeared dead, except here and there one, which was still secreting. It is evident that this oil is highly exciting and poisonous to Drosera. Oil of Cloves.—A mixture was made in the same manner as in the last case, and three leaves were immersed in it. After 30 m. there was only a trace of inflection which never increased. After 1 hr. 30 m. the glands were pale, and after 6 hrs. white. No doubt the leaves were much injured or killed. Turpentine.—Small drops placed on the discs of some leaves killed them, as did likewise drops of creosote. A plant was left for 15 m. under a 12-oz. vessel, with its inner surface wetted with twelve drops of turpentine; but no movement of the tentacles ensued. After 24 hrs. the plant was dead. Glycerine.—Half-minims were placed on the discs of three leaves: in 2 hrs. some of the outer tentacles were irregularly inflected; and in 19 hrs. the leaves were flaccid and apparently dead; the glands which had touched the glycerine were colourless. Minute drops (about 1/20 of a minim) were applied to the glands of several tentacles, and in a few minutes these moved and soon reached the centre. Similar drops of a mixture of four dropped drops to 1 oz. of water were likewise applied to several glands; but only a few of the tentacles moved, and these very slowly and slightly. Half-minims of this same mixture placed on the discs of some leaves caused, to my surprise, no inflection in the course of 48 hrs. Bits of meat were then given them, and next day they were well inflected; notwithstanding that some of the discal glands had been rendered almost colourless. Two leaves were immersed in the same mixture, but only for 4 hrs.; they were not inflected, and on being afterwards left for 2 hrs. 30 m. in a solution (1 gr. to 1 oz.) of carbonate of ammonia, their glands were blackened, their tentacles inflected, and the protoplasm within their cells aggregated. It appears [page 213] from these facts that a mixture of four drops of glycerine to an ounce of water is not poisonous, and excites very little inflection; but that pure glycerine is poisonous, and if applied in very minute quantities to the glands of the outer tentacles causes their inflection. The Effects of Immersion in Water and in various Solutions on the subsequent Action of Phosphate and Carbonate of Ammonia.—We have seen in the third and seventh chapters that immersion in distilled water causes after a time some degree of aggregation of the protoplasm, and a moderate amount of inflection, especially in the case of plants which have been kept at a rather high temperature. Water does not excite a copious secretion of mucus. We have here to consider the effects of immersion in various fluids on the subsequent action of salts of ammonia and other stimulants. Four leaves which had been left for 24 hrs. in water were given bits of meat, but did not clasp them. Ten leaves, after a similar immersion, were left for 24 hrs. in a powerful solution (1 gr. to 20 oz.) of phosphate of ammonia, and only one showed even a trace of inflection. Three of these leaves, on being left for an additional day in the solution, still remained quite unaffected. When, however, some of these leaves, which had been first immersed in water for 24 hrs., and then in the phosphate for 24 hrs. were placed in a solution of carbonate of ammonia (one part to 218 of water), the protoplasm in the cells of the tentacles became in a few hours strongly aggregated, showing that this salt had been absorbed and taken effect. A short immersion in water for 20 m. did not retard the subsequent action of the phosphate, or of splinters of glass placed on the glands; but in two instances an immersion for 50 m. prevented any effect from a solution of camphor. Several leaves which had been left for 20 m. in a solution of one part of white sugar to 218 of water were placed in the phosphate solution, the action of which was delayed; whereas a mixed solution of sugar and the phosphate did not in the least interfere with the effects of the latter. Three leaves, after being immersed for 20 m. in the sugar solution, were placed in a solution of carbonate of ammonia (one part to 218 of water); in 2 m. or 3 m. the glands were blackened, and after 7 m. the tentacles were considerably inflected, so that the solution of sugar, though it delayed the action of the phosphate, did not delay that of the carbonate. Immersion in a similar solution of gum arabic for 20 m. had no retarding action on the phosphate. Three leaves were left for 20 m. in a mixture of one part of alcohol to seven parts of water, [page 214] and then placed in the phosphate solution: in 2 hrs. 15 m. there was a trace of inflection in one leaf, and in 5 hrs. 30 m. a second was slightly affected; the inflection subsequently increased, though slowly. Hence diluted alcohol, which, as we shall see, is hardly at all poisonous, plainly retards the subsequent action of the phosphate. It was shown in the last chapter that leaves which did not become inflected by nearly a day’s immersion in solutions of various salts and acids behaved very differently from one another when subsequently placed in the phosphate solution. I here give a table summing up the results. Column 1 : Name of the Salts and Acids in Solution. Column 2 : Period of Immersion of the Leaves in Solutions of one part to 437 of water. Column 3 : Effects produced on the Leaves by their subsequent Immersion for stated periods in a Solution of one part of phosphate of ammonia to 8750 of water, or 1 gr. to 20 oz. Rubidium chloride. : 22 hrs. : After 30 m. strong inflection of the tentacles. Potassium carbonate : 20 m. : Scarcely any inflection until 5 hrs. had elapsed. Calcium acetate. : 24 hrs. : After 24 hrs. very slight inflection. Calcium nitrate. : 24 hrs. : Do. do. Magnesium acetate. : 22 hrs. : Some slight inflection, which became well pronounced in 24 hrs. Magnesium nitrate. : 22 hrs. : After 4 hrs. 30 m. a fair amount of inflection, which never increased. Magnesium chloride : 22 hrs. : After a few minutes great inflection; after 4 hrs. all four leaves with almost every tentacle closely inflected. Barium acetate. : 22 hrs. : After 24 hrs. two leaves out of four slightly inflected. Barium nitrate. : 22 hrs. : After 30 m. one leaf greatly, and two others moderately, inflected; they remained thus for 24 hrs. Strontium acetate. : 22 hrs. : After 25 m. two leaves greatly inflected; after 8 hrs. a third leaf moderately, and the fourth very slightly, inflected. All four thus remained for 24 hrs. Strontium nitrate. : 22 hrs. : After 8 hrs. three leaves out of five moderately inflected; after 24 hrs. all five in this state; but not one closely inflected. Aluminium chloride : 24 hrs. : Three leaves which had either been slightly or not at all affected by the chloride became after 7 hrs. 30 m. rather closely inflected. [page 215] Column 1 : Name of the Salts and Acids in Solution. Column 2 : Period of Immersion of the Leaves in Solutions of one part to 437 of water. Column 3 : Effects produced on the Leaves by their subsequent Immersion for stated periods in a Solution of one part of phosphate of ammonia to 8750 of water, or 1 gr. to 20 oz. Aluminium nitrate. : 24 hrs. : After 25 hrs. slight and doubtful effect. Lead chloride. : 23 hrs. : After 24 hrs. two leaves somewhat inflected, the third very little; and thus remained. Manganese chloride : 22 hrs. : After 48 hrs. not the least inflection. Lactic acid. : 48 hrs. : After 24 hrs. a trace of inflection in a few tentacles, the glands of which had not been killed by the acid. Tannic acid. : 24 hrs. : After 24 hrs. no inflection. Tartaric acid. : 24 hrs. : Do. do. Citric acid. : 24 hrs. : After 50 m. tentacles decidedly inflected, and after 5 hrs. strongly inflected; so remained for the next 24 hrs. Formic acid. : 22 hrs. : Not observed until 24 hrs. had elapsed; tentacles considerably inflected, and protoplasm aggregated. In a large majority of these twenty cases, a varying degree of inflection was slowly caused by the phosphate. In four cases, however, the inflection was rapid, occurring in less than half an hour or at most in 50 m. In three cases the phosphate did not produce the least effect. Now what are we to infer from these facts? We know from ten trials that immersion in distilled water for 24 hrs. prevents the subsequent action of the phosphate solution. It would, therefore, appear as if the solutions of chloride of manganese, tannic and tartaric acids, which are not poisonous, acted exactly like water, for the phosphate produced no effect on the leaves which had been previously immersed in these three solutions. The majority of the other solutions behaved to a certain extent like water, for the phosphate produced, after a considerable interval of time, only a slight effect. On the other hand, the leaves which had been immersed in the solutions of the chloride of rubidium and magnesium, of acetate of strontium, nitrate of barium, and citric acid, were quickly acted on by the phosphate. Now was water absorbed from these five weak solutions, and yet, owing to the presence of the salts, did not prevent the subsequent action of the phosphate? Or [page 216] may we not suppose* that the interstices of the walls of the glands were blocked up with the molecules of these five substances, so that they were rendered impermeable to water; for had water entered, we know from the ten trials that the phosphate would not afterwards have produced any effect? It further appears that the molecules of the carbonate of ammonia can quickly pass into glands which, from having been immersed for 20 m. in a weak solution of sugar, either absorb the phosphate very slowly or are acted on by it very slowly. On the other hand, glands, however they may have been treated, seem easily to permit the subsequent entrance of the molecules of carbonate of ammonia. Thus leaves which had been immersed in a solution (of one part to 437 of water) of nitrate of potassium for 48 hrs.—of sulphate of potassium for 24 hrs.—and of the chloride of potassium for 25 hrs.—on being placed in a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 218 of water, had their glands immediately blackened, and after 1 hr. their tentacles somewhat inflected, and the protoplasm aggregated. But it would be an endless task to endeavour to ascertain the wonderfully diversified effects of various solutions on Drosera. Alcohol (one part to seven of water).—It has already been shown that half-minims of this strength placed on the discs of leaves do not cause any inflection; and that when two days afterwards the leaves were given bits of meat, they became strongly inflected. Four leaves were immersed in this mixture, and two of them after 30 m. were brushed with a camel-hair brush, like the leaves in the solution of camphor, but this produced no effect. * See Dr. M. Traube’s curious experiments on the production of artificial cells, and on their permeability to various salts, described in his papers: “Experimente zur Theorie der Zellenbildung und Endosmose,” Breslau, 1866; and “Experimente zur physicalischen Erklrung der Bildung der Zellhaut, ihres Wachsthums durch Intussusception,” Breslau, 1874. These researches perhaps explain my results. Dr. Traube commonly employed as a membrane the precipitate formed when tannic acid comes into contact with a solution of gelatine. By allowing a precipitation of sulphate of barium to take place at the same time, the membrane becomes “infiltrated” with this salt; and in consequence of the intercalation of molecules of sulphate of barium among those of the gelatine precipitate, the molecular interstices in the membrane are made smaller. In this altered condition, the membrane no longer allows the passage through it of either sulphate of ammonia or nitrate of barium, though it retains its permeability for water and chloride of ammonia. [page 217] Nor did these four leaves, on being left for 24 hrs. in the diluted alcohol, undergo any inflection. They were then removed; one being placed in an infusion of raw meat, and bits of meat on the discs of the other three, with their stalks in water. Next day one seemed a little injured, whilst two others showed merely a trace of inflection. We must, however, bear in mind that immersion for 24 hrs. in water prevents leaves from clasping meat. Hence alcohol of the above strength is not poisonous, nor does it stimulate the leaves like camphor does. The vapour of alcohol acts differently. A plant having three good leaves was left for 25 m. under a receiver holding 19 oz. with sixty minims of alcohol in a watch-glass. No movement ensued, but some few of the glands were blackened and shrivelled, whilst many became quite pale. These were scattered over all the leaves in the most irregular manner, reminding me of the manner in which the glands were affected by the vapour of carbonate of ammonia. Immediately on the removal of the receiver particles of raw meat were placed on many of the glands, those which retained their proper colour being chiefly selected. But not a single tentacle was inflected during the next 4 hrs. After the first 2 hrs. the glands on all the tentacles began to dry; and next morning, after 22 hrs., all three leaves appeared almost dead, with their glands dry; the tentacles on one leaf alone being partially inflected. A second plant was left for only 5 m. with some alcohol in a watch-glass, under a 12-oz. receiver, and particles of meat were then placed on the glands of several tentacles. After 10 m. some of them began to curve inwards, and after 55 m. nearly all were considerably inflected; but a few did not move. Some anaesthetic effect is here probable, but by no means certain. A third plant was also left for 5 m. under the same small vessel, with its whole inner surface wetted with about a dozen drops of alcohol. Particles of meat were now placed on the glands of several tentacles, some of which first began to move in 25 m.; after 40 m. most of them were somewhat inflected, and after 1 hr. 10 m. almost all were considerably inflected. From their slow rate of movement there can be no doubt that the glands of these tentacles had been rendered insensible for a time by exposure during 5 m. to the vapour of alcohol. Vapour of Chloroform.—The action of this vapour on Drosera is very variable, depending, I suppose, on the constitution or age of the plant, or on some unknown condition. It sometimes causes the tentacles to move with extraordinary rapidity, and sometimes produces no such effect. The glands are sometimes [page 218] rendered for a time insensible to the action of raw meat, but sometimes are not thus affected, or in a very slight degree. A plant recovers from a small dose, but is easily killed by a larger one. A plant was left for 30 m. under a bell-glass holding 19 fluid oz. (539.6 ml.) with eight drops of chloroform, and before the cover was removed, most of the tentacles became much inflected, though they did not reach the centre. After the cover was removed, bits of meat were placed on the glands of several of the somewhat incurved tentacles; these glands were found much blackened after 6 hrs. 30 m., but no further movement ensued. After 24 hrs. the leaves appeared almost dead. A smaller bell-glass, holding 12 fluid oz. (340.8 ml.), was now employed, and a plant was left for 90 s. under it, with only two drops of chloroform. Immediately on the removal of the glass all the tentacles curved inwards so as to stand perpendicularly up; and some of them could actually be seen moving with extraordinary quickness by little starts, and therefore in an unnatural manner; but they never reached the centre. After 22 hrs. they fully re-expanded, and on meat being placed on their glands, or when roughly touched by a needle, they promptly became inflected; so that these leaves had not been in the least injured. Another plant was placed under the same small bell-glass with three drops of chloroform, and before two minutes had elapsed, the tentacles began to curl inwards with rapid little jerks. The glass was then removed, and in the course of two or three additional minutes almost every tentacle reached the centre. On several other occasions the vapour did not excite any movement of this kind. There seems also to be great variability in the degree and manner in which chloroform renders the glands insensible to the subsequent action of meat. In the plant last referred to, which had been exposed for 2 m. to three drops of chloroform, some few tentacles curved up only to a perpendicular position, and particles of meat were placed on their glands; this caused them in 5 m. to begin moving, but they moved so slowly that they did not reach the centre until 1 hr. 30 m. had elapsed. Another plant was similarly exposed, that is, for 2 m. to three drops of chloroform, and on particles of meat being placed on the glands of several tentacles, which had curved up into a perpendicular position, one of these began to bend in 8 m., but afterwards moved very slowly; whilst none of the other tentacles [page 219] moved for the next 40 m. Nevertheless, in 1 hr. 45 m. from the time when the bits of meat had been given, all the tentacles reached the centre. In this case some slight anaesthetic effect apparently had been produced. On the following day the plant had perfectly recovered. Another plant bearing two leaves was exposed for 2 m. under the 19-oz. vessel to two drops of chloroform; it was then taken out and examined; again exposed for 2 m. to two drops; taken out, and re-exposed for 3 m. to three drops; so that altogether it was exposed alternately to the air and during 7 m. to the vapour of seven drops of chloroform. Bits of meat were now placed on thirteen glands on the two leaves. On one of these leaves, a single tentacle first began moving in 40 m., and two others in 54 m. On the second leaf some tentacles first moved in 1 hr. 11 m. After 2 hrs. many tentacles on both leaves were inflected; but none had reached the centre within this time. In this case there could not be the least doubt that the chloroform had exerted an anaesthetic influence on the leaves. On the other hand, another plant was exposed under the same vessel for a much longer time, viz. 20 m., to twice as much chloroform. Bits of meat were then placed on the glands of many tentacles, and all of them, with a single exception, reached the centre in from 13 m. to 14 m. In this case, little or no anaesthetic effect had been produced; and how to reconcile these discordant results, I know not. Vapour of Sulphuric Ether.—A plant was exposed for 30 m. to thirty minims of this ether in a vessel holding 19 oz.; and bits of raw meat were afterwards placed on many glands which had become pale-coloured; but none of the tentacles moved. After 6 hrs. 30 m. the leaves appeared sickly, and the discal glands were almost dry. By the next morning many of the tentacles were dead, as were all those on which meat had been placed; showing that matter had been absorbed from the meat which had increased the evil effects of the vapour. After four days the plant itself died. Another plant was exposed in the same vessel for 15 m. to forty minims. One young, small, and tender leaf had all its tentacles inflected, and seemed much injured. Bits of raw meat were placed on several glands on two other and older leaves. These glands became dry after 6 hrs.; and seemed injured; the tentacles never moved, excepting one which was ultimately a little inflected. The glands of the other tentacles continued to secrete, and appeared uninjured, but the whole plant after three days became very sickly. [page 220] In the two foregoing experiments the doses were evidently too large and poisonous. With weaker doses, the anaesthetic effect was variable, as in the case of chloroform. A plant was exposed for 5 m. to ten drops under a 12-oz. vessel, and bits of meat were then placed on many glands. None of the tentacles thus treated began to move in a decided manner until 40 m. had elapsed; but then some of them moved very quickly, so that two reached the centre after an additional interval of only 10 m. In 2 hrs. 12 m. from the time when the meat was given, all the tentacles reached the centre. Another plant, with two leaves, was exposed in the same vessel for 5 m. to a rather larger dose of ether, and bits of meat were placed on several glands. In this case one tentacle on each leaf began to bend in 5 m.; and after 12 m. two tentacles on one leaf, and one on the second leaf, reached the centre. In 30 m. after the meat had been given, all the tentacles, both those with and without meat, were closely inflected; so that the ether apparently had stimulated these leaves, causing all the tentacles to bend. Vapour of Nitric Ether.—This vapour seems more injurious than that of sulphuric ether. A plant was exposed for 5 m. in a 12-oz. vessel to eight drops in a watch-glass, and I distinctly saw a few tentacles curling inwards before the glass was removed. Immediately afterwards bits of meat were placed on three glands, but no movement ensued in the course of 18 m. The same plant was placed again under the same vessel for 16 m. with ten drops of the ether. None of the tentacles moved, and next morning those with the meat were still in the same position. After 48 hrs. one leaf seemed healthy, but the others were much injured. Another plant, having two good leaves, was exposed for 6 m. under a 19-oz. vessel to the vapour from ten minims of the ether, and bits of meat were then placed on the glands of many tentacles on both leaves. After 36 m. several of them on one leaf became inflected, and after 1 hr. almost all the tentacles, those with and without meat, nearly reached the centre. On the other leaf the glands began to dry in 1 hr. 40 m., and after several hours not a single tentacle was inflected; but by the next morning, after 21 hrs., many were inflected, though they seemed much injured. In this and the previous experiment, it is doubtful, owing to the injury which the leaves had suffered, whether any anaesthetic effect had been produced. A third plant, having two good leaves, was exposed for only 4 m. in the 19-oz. vessel to the vapour from six drops. Bits of meat were then placed on the glands of seven tentacles on the [page 221] same leaf. A single tentacle moved after 1 hr. 23 m.; after 2 hrs. 3 m. several were inflected; and after 3 hrs. 3 m. all the seven tentacles with meat were well inflected. From the slowness of these movements it is clear that this leaf had been rendered insensible for a time to the action of the meat. A second leaf was rather differently affected; bits of meat were placed on the glands of five tentacles, three of which were slightly inflected in 28 m.; after 1 hr. 21 m. one reached the centre, but the other two were still only slightly inflected; after 3 hrs. they were much more inflected; but even after 5 hrs. 16 m. all five had not reached the centre. Although some of the tentacles began to move moderately soon, they afterwards moved with extreme slowness. By next morning, after 20 hrs., most of the tentacles on both leaves were closely inflected, but not quite regularly. After 48 hrs. neither leaf appeared injured, though the tentacles were still inflected; after 72 hrs. one was almost dead, whilst the other was re-expanding and recovering. Carbonic Acid.—A plant was placed under a 122-oz. bell-glass filled with this gas and standing over water; but I did not make sufficient allowance for the absorption of the gas by the water, so that towards the latter part of the experiment some air was drawn in. After an exposure of 2 hrs. the plant was removed, and bits of raw meat placed on the glands of three leaves. One of these leaves hung a little down, and was at first partly and soon afterwards completely covered by the water, which rose within the vessel as the gas was absorbed. On this latter leaf the tentacles, to which meat had been given, became well inflected in 2 m. 30 s., that is, at about the normal rate; so that until I remembered that the leaf had been protected from the gas, and might perhaps have absorbed oxygen from the water which was continually drawn inwards, I falsely concluded that the carbonic acid had produced no effect. On the other two leaves, the tentacles with meat behaved very differently from those on the first leaf; two of them first began to move slightly in 1 hr. 50 m., always reckoning from the time when the meat was placed on the glands—were plainly inflected in 2 hrs. 22 m.—and in 3 hrs 22 m. reached the centre. Three other tentacles did not begin to move until 2 hrs. 20 m. had elapsed, but reached the centre at about the same time with the others, viz. in 3 hrs. 22 m. This experiment was repeated several times with nearly the same results, excepting that the interval before the tentacles began to move varied a little. I will give only one other case. [page 222] A plant was exposed in the same vessel to the gas for 45 m., and bits of meat were then placed on four glands. But the tentacles did not move for 1 hr. 40 m.; after 2 hrs. 30 m. all four were well inflected, and after 3 hrs. reached the centre. The following singular phenomenon sometimes, but by no means always, occurred. A plant was immersed for 2 hrs., and bits of meat were then placed on several glands. In the course of 13 m. all the submarginal tentacles on one leaf became considerably inflected; those with the meat not in the least degree more than the others. On a second leaf, which was rather old, the tentacles with meat, as well as a few others, were moderately inflected. On a third leaf all the tentacles were closely inflected, though meat had not been placed on any of the glands. This movement, I presume, may be attributed to excitement from the absorption of oxygen. The last-mentioned leaf, to which no meat had been given, was fully re-expanded after 24 hrs.; whereas the two other leaves had all their tentacles closely inflected over the bits of meat which by this time had been carried to their centres. Thus these three leaves had perfectly recovered from the effects of the gas in the course of 24 hrs. On another occasion some fine plants, after having been left for 2 hrs. in the gas, were immediately given bits of meat in the usual manner, and on their exposure to the air most of their tentacles became in 12 m. curved into a vertical or sub-vertical position, but in an extremely irregular manner; some only on one side of the leaf and some on the other. They remained in this position for some time; the tentacles with the bits of meat not having at first moved more quickly or farther inwards than the others without meat. But after 2 hrs. 20 m. the former began to move, and steadily went on bending until they reached the centre. Next morning, after 22 hrs., all the tentacles on these leaves were closely clasped over the meat which had been carried to their centres; whilst the vertical and sub-vertical tentacles on the other leaves to which no meat had been given had fully re-expanded. Judging, however, from the subsequent action of a weak solution of carbonate of ammonia on one of these latter leaves, it had not perfectly recovered its excitability and power of movement in 22 hrs.; but another leaf, after an additional 24 hrs., had completely recovered, judging from the manner in which it clasped a fly placed on its disc. I will give only one other experiment. After the exposure of a plant for 2 hrs. to the gas, one of its leaves was immersed in a rather strong solution of carbonate of ammonia, together with [page 223] a fresh leaf from another plant. The latter had most of its tentacles strongly inflected within 30 m.; whereas the leaf which had been exposed to the carbonic acid remained for 24 hrs. in the solution without undergoing any inflection, with the exception of two tentacles. This leaf had been almost completely paralysed, and was not able to recover its sensibility whilst still in the solution, which from having been made with distilled water probably contained little oxygen.] Concluding Remarks on the Effects of the foregoing Agents.—As the glands, when excited, transmit some influence to the surrounding tentacles, causing them to bend and their glands to pour forth an increased amount of modified secretion, I was anxious to ascertain whether the leaves included any element having the nature of nerve-tissue, which, though not continuous, served as the channel of transmission. This led me to try the several alkaloids and other substances which are known to exert a powerful influence on the nervous system of animals; I was at first encouraged in my trials by finding that strychnine, digitaline, and nicotine, which all act on the nervous system, were poisonous to Drosera, and caused a certain amount of inflection. Hydrocyanic acid, again, which is so deadly a poison to animals, caused rapid movement of the tentacles. But as several innocuous acids, though much diluted, such as benzoic, acetic, &c., as well as some essential oils, are extremely poisonous to Drosera, and quickly cause strong inflection, it seems probable that strychnine, nicotine, digitaline, and hydrocyanic acid, excite inflection by acting on elements in no way analogous to the nerve-cells of animals. If elements of this latter nature had been present in the leaves, it might have been expected that morphia, hyoscyamus, atropine, veratrine, colchicine, curare, and diluted alcohol would have produced some marked effect; whereas [page 224] these substances are not poisonous and have no power, or only a very slight one, of inducing inflection. It should, however, be observed that curare, colchicine, and veratrine are muscle-poisons—that is, act on nerves having some special relation with the muscles, and, therefore, could not be expected to act on Drosera. The poison of the cobra is most deadly to animals, by paralysing their nerve-centres,* yet is not in the least so to Drosera, though quickly causing strong inflection. Notwithstanding the foregoing facts, which show how widely different is the effect of certain substances on the health or life of animals and of Drosera, yet there exists a certain degree of parallelism in the action of certain other substances. We have seen that this holds good in a striking manner with the salts of sodium and potassium. Again, various metallic salts and acids, namely those of silver, mercury, gold, tin, arsenic, chromium, copper, and platina, most or all of which are highly poisonous to animals, are equally so to Drosera. But it is a singular fact that the chloride of lead and two salts of barium were not poisonous to this plant. It is an equally strange fact, that, though acetic and propionic acids are highly poisonous, their ally, formic acid, is not so; and that, whilst certain vegetable acids, namely oxalic, benzoic, &c., are poisonous in a high degree, gallic, tannic, tartaric, and malic (all diluted to an equal degree) are not so. Malic acid induces inflection, whilst the three other just named vegetable acids have no such power. But a pharmacopoeia would be requisite to describe the diversified effects of various substances on Drosera.** * Dr. Fayrer, ‘The Thanatophidia of India,’ 1872, p. 4. ** Seeing that acetic, hydrocyanic, and chromic acids, acetate of strychnine, and vapour of ether, are poisonous to Drosera, [[page 225]] it is remarkable that Dr. Ransom (‘Philosoph. Transact.’ 1867, p. 480), who used much stronger solutions of these substances than I did, states “that the rhythmic contractility of the yolk (of the ova of the pike) is not materially influenced by any of the poisons used, which did not act chemically, with the exception of chloroform and carbonic acid.” I find it stated by several writers that curare has no influence on sarcode or protoplasm, and we have seen that, though curare excites some degree of inflection, it causes very little aggregation of the protoplasm.) [page 226] Of the alkaloids and their salts which were tried, several had not the least power of inducing inflection; others, which were certainly absorbed, as shown by the changed colour of the glands, had but a very moderate power of this kind; others, again, such as the acetate of quinine and digitaline, caused strong inflection. The several substances mentioned in this chapter affect the colour of the glands very differently. These often become dark at first, and then very pale or white, as was conspicuously the case with glands subjected to the poison of the cobra and citrate of strychnine. In other cases they are from the first rendered white, as with leaves placed in hot water and several acids; and this, I presume, is the result of the coagulation of the albumen. On the same leaf some glands become white and others dark-coloured, as occurred with leaves in a solution of the sulphate of quinine, and in the vapour of alcohol. Prolonged immersion in nicotine, curare, and even water, blackens the glands; and this, I believe, is due to the aggregation of the protoplasm within their cells. Yet curare caused very little aggregation in the cells of the tentacles, whereas nicotine and sulphate of quinine induced strongly marked aggregation down their bases. The aggregated masses in leaves which had been immersed for 3 hrs. 15 m. in a saturated solution of sulphate of quinine exhibited incessant [page 226] changes of form, but after 24 hrs. were motionless; the leaf being flaccid and apparently dead. On the other hand, with leaves subjected for 48 hrs. to a strong solution of the poison of the cobra, the protoplasmic masses were unusually active, whilst with the higher animals the vibratile cilia and white corpuscles of the blood seem to be quickly paralysed by this substance. With the salts of alkalies and earths, the nature of the base, and not that of the acid, determines their physiological action on Drosera, as is likewise the case with animals; but this rule hardly applies to the salts of quinine and strychnine, for the acetate of quinine causes much more inflection than the sulphate, and both are poisonous, whereas the nitrate of quinine is not poisonous, and induces inflection at a much slower rate than the acetate. The action of the citrate of strychnine is also somewhat different from that of the sulphate. Leaves which have been immersed for 24 hrs. in water, and for only 20 m. in diluted alcohol, or in a weak solution of sugar, are afterwards acted on very slowly, or not at all, by the phosphate of ammonia, though they are quickly acted on by the carbonate. Immersion for 20 m. in a solution of gum arabic has no such inhibitory power. The solutions of certain salts and acids affect the leaves, with respect to the subsequent action of the phosphate, exactly like water, whilst others allow the phosphate afterwards to act quickly and energetically. In this latter case, the interstices of the cell-walls may have been blocked up by the molecules of the salts first given in solution, so that water could not afterwards enter, though the molecules of the phosphate could do so, and those of the carbonate still more easily. [page 227] The action of camphor dissolved in water is remarkable, for it not only soon induces inflection, but apparently renders the glands extremely sensitive to mechanical irritation; for if they are brushed with a soft brush, after being immersed in the solution for a short time, the tentacles begin to bend in about 2 m. It may, however, be that the brushing, though not a sufficient stimulus by itself, tends to excite movement merely by reinforcing the direct action of the camphor. The vapour of camphor, on the other hand, serves as a narcotic. Some essential oils, both in solution and in vapour, cause rapid inflection, others have no such power; those which I tried were all poisonous. Diluted alcohol (one part to seven of water) is not poisonous, does not induce inflection, nor increase the sensitiveness of the glands to mechanical irritation. The vapour acts as a narcotic or anaesthetic, and long exposure to it kills the leaves. The vapours of chloroform, sulphuric and nitric ether, act in a singularly variable manner on different leaves, and on the several tentacles of the same leaf. This, I suppose, is owing to differences in the age or constitution of the leaves, and to whether certain tentacles have lately been in action. That these vapours are absorbed by the glands is shown by their changed colour; but as other plants not furnished with glands are affected by these vapours, it is probable that they are likewise absorbed by the stomata of Drosera. They sometimes excite extraordinarily rapid inflection, but this is not an invariable result. If allowed to act for even a moderately long time, they kill the leaves; whilst a small dose acting for only a short time serves as a narcotic or anaesthetic. In this case the tentacles, whether or not they have [page 228] become inflected, are not excited to further movement by bits of meat placed on the glands, until some considerable time has elapsed. It is generally believed that with animals and plants these vapours act by arresting oxidation. Exposure to carbonic acid for 2 hrs., and in one case for only 45 m., likewise rendered the glands insensible for a time to the powerful stimulus of raw meat. The leaves, however, recovered their full powers, and did not seem in the least injured, on being left in the air for 24 or 48 hrs. We have seen in the third chapter that the process of aggregation in leaves subjected for two hours to this gas and then immersed in a solution of the carbonate of ammonia is much retarded, so that a considerable time elapses before the protoplasm in the lower cells of the tentacles becomes aggregated. In some cases, soon after the leaves were removed from the gas and brought into the air, the tentacles moved spontaneously; this being due, I presume, to the excitement from the access of oxygen. These inflected tentacles, however, could not be excited for some time afterwards to any further movement by their glands being stimulated. With other irritable plants it is known* that the exclusion of oxygen prevents their moving, and arrests the movements of the protoplasm within their cells, but this arrest is a different phenomenon from the retardation of the process of aggregation just alluded to. Whether this latter fact ought to be attributed to the direct action of the carbonic acid, or to the exclusion of oxygen, I know not. * Sachs, ‘Traité de Bot.’ 1874, pp. 846, 1037. [page 229] ',\n",
              " 'X. ON THE SENSITIVENESS OF THE LEAVES, AND ON THE LINES OF TRANSMISSION OF THE MOTOR IMPULSE. Glands and summits of the tentacles alone sensitive—Transmission of the motor impulse down the pedicels of the tentacles, and across the blade of the leaf—Aggregation of the protoplasm, a reflex action—First discharge of the motor impulse sudden—Direction of the movements of the tentacles—Motor impulse transmitted through the cellular tissue— Mechanism of the movements—Nature of the motor impulse—Re-expansion of the tentacles. We have seen in the previous chapters that many widely different stimulants, mechanical and chemical, excite the movement of the tentacles, as well as of the blade of the leaf; and we must now consider, firstly, what are the points which are irritable or sensitive, and secondly how the motor impulse is transmitted from one point to another. The glands are almost exclusively the seat of irritability, yet this irritability must extend for a very short distance below them; for when they were cut off with a sharp pair of scissors without being themselves touched, the tentacles often became inflected. These headless tentacles frequently re-expanded; and when afterwards drops of the two most powerful known stimulants were placed on the cut-off ends, no effect was produced. Nevertheless these headless tentacles are capable of subsequent inflection if excited by an impulse sent from the disc. I succeeded on several occasions in crushing glands between fine pincers, but this did not excite any movement; nor did raw meat and salts of ammonia, when placed on such crushed glands. [page 230] It is probable that they were killed so instantly that they were not able to transmit any motor impulse; for in six observed cases (in two of which however the gland was quite pinched off) the protoplasm within the cells of the tentacles did not become aggregated; whereas in some adjoining tentacles, which were inflected from having been roughly touched by the pincers, it was well aggregated. In like manner the protoplasm does not become aggregated when a leaf is instantly killed by being dipped into boiling water. On the other hand, in several cases in which tentacles became inflected after their glands had been cut off with sharp scissors, a distinct though moderate degree of aggregation supervened. The pedicels of the tentacles were roughly and repeatedly rubbed; raw meat or other exciting substances were placed on them, both on the upper surface near the base and elsewhere, but no distinct movement ensued. Some bits of meat, after being left for a considerable time on the pedicels, were pushed upwards, so as just to touch the glands, and in a minute the tentacles began to bend. I believe that the blade of the leaf is not sensitive to any stimulant. I drove the point of a lancet through the blades of several leaves, and a needle three or four times through nineteen leaves: in the former case no movement ensued; but about a dozen of the leaves which were repeatedly pricked had a few tentacles irregularly inflected. As, however, their backs had to be supported during the operation, some of the outer glands, as well as those on the disc, may have been touched; and this perhaps sufficed to cause the slight degree of movement observed. Nitschke*says * ‘Bot. Zeitung,’ 1860, p. 234. [page 231] that cutting and pricking the leaf does not excite movement. The petiole of the leaf is quite insensible. The backs of the leaves bear numerous minute papillae, which do not secrete, but have the power of absorption. These papillae are, I believe, rudiments of formerly existing tentacles together with their glands. Many experiments were made to ascertain whether the backs of the leaves could be irritated in any way, thirty-seven leaves being thus tried. Some were rubbed for a long time with a blunt needle, and drops of milk and other exciting fluids, raw meat, crushed flies, and various substances, placed on others. These substances were apt soon to become dry, showing that no secretion had been excited. Hence I moistened them with saliva, solutions of ammonia, weak hydrochloric acid, and frequently with the secretion from the glands of other leaves. I also kept some leaves, on the backs of which exciting objects had been placed, under a damp bell-glass; but with all my care I never saw any true movement. I was led to make so many trials because, contrary to my previous experience, Nitschke states* that, after affixing objects to the backs of leaves by the aid of the viscid secretion, he repeatedly saw the tentacles (and in one instance the blade) become reflexed. This movement, if a true one, would be most anomalous; for it implies that the tentacles receive a motor impulse from an unnatural source, and have the power of bending in a direction exactly the reverse of that which is habitual to them; this power not being of the least use to the plant, as insects cannot adhere to the smooth backs of the leaves. I have said that no effect was produced in the above * ‘Bot. Zeitung.’ 1860, p. 437. [page 232] cases; but this is not strictly true, for in three instances a little syrup was added to the bits of raw meat on the backs of leaves, in order to keep them damp for a time; and after 36 hrs. there was a trace of reflexion in the tentacles of one leaf, and certainly in the blade of another. After twelve additional hours, the glands began to dry, and all three leaves seemed much injured. Four leaves were then placed under a bell-glass, with their footstalks in water, with drops of syrup on their backs, but without any meat. Two of these leaves, after a day, had a few tentacles reflexed. The drops had now increased considerably in size, from having imbibed moisture, so as to trickle down the backs of the tentacles and footstalks. On the second day, one leaf had its blade much reflexed; on the third day the tentacles of two were much reflexed, as well as the blades of all four to a greater or less degree. The upper side of one leaf, instead of being, as at first, slightly concave, now presented a strong convexity upwards. Even on the fifth day the leaves did not appear dead. Now, as sugar does not in the least excite Drosera, we may safely attribute the reflexion of the blades and tentacles of the above leaves to exosmose from the cells which were in contact with the syrup, and their consequent contraction. When drops of syrup are placed on the leaves of plants with their roots still in damp earth, no inflection ensues, for the roots, no doubt, pump up water as quickly as it is lost by exosmose. But if cut-off leaves are immersed in syrup, or in any dense fluid, the tentacles are greatly, though irregularly, inflected, some of them assuming the shape of corkscrews; and the leaves soon become flaccid. If they are now immersed in a fluid of low specific gravity, the tentacles re-expand. From these [page 233] facts we may conclude that drops of syrup placed on the backs of leaves do not act by exciting a motor impulse which is transmitted to the tentacles; but that they cause reflexion by inducing exosmose. Dr. Nitschke used the secretion for sticking insects to the backs of the leaves; and I suppose that he used a large quantity, which from being dense probably caused exosmose. Perhaps he experimented on cut-off leaves, or on plants with their roots not supplied with enough water. As far, therefore, as our present knowledge serves, we may conclude that the glands, together with the immediately underlying cells of the tentacles, are the exclusive seats of that irritability or sensitiveness with which the leaves are endowed. The degree to which a gland is excited can be measured only by the number of the surrounding tentacles which are inflected, and by the amount and rate of their movement. Equally vigorous leaves, exposed to the same temperature (and this is an important condition), are excited in different degrees under the following circumstances. A minute quantity of a weak solution produces no effect; add more, or give a rather stronger solution, and the tentacles bend. Touch a gland once or twice, and no movement follows; touch it three or four times, and the tentacle becomes inflected. But the nature of the substance which is given is a very important element: if equal-sized particles of glass (which acts only mechanically), of gelatine, and raw meat, are placed on the discs of several leaves, the meat causes far more rapid, energetic, and widely extended movement than the two former substances. The number of glands which are excited also makes a great difference in the result: place a bit of meat on one or two of the discal [page 234] glands, and only a few of the immediately surrounding short tentacles are inflected; place it on several glands, and many more are acted on; place it on thirty or forty, and all the tentacles, including the extreme marginal ones, become closely inflected. We thus see that the impulses proceeding from a number of glands strengthen one another, spread farther, and act on a larger number of tentacles, than the impulse from any single gland. Transmission of the Motor Impulse.—In every case the impulse from a gland has to travel for at least a short distance to the basal part of the tentacle, the upper part and the gland itself being merely carried by the inflection of the lower part. The impulse is thus always transmitted down nearly the whole length of the pedicel. When the central glands are stimulated, and the extreme marginal tentacles become inflected, the impulse is transmitted across half the diameter of the disc; and when the glands on one side of the disc are stimulated, the impulse is transmitted across nearly the whole width of the disc. A gland transmits its motor impulse far more easily and quickly down its own tentacle to the bending place than across the disc to neighbouring tentacles. Thus a minute dose of a very weak solution of ammonia, if given to one of the glands of the exterior tentacles, causes it to bend and reach the centre; whereas a large drop of the same solution, given to a score of glands on the disc, will not cause through their combined influence the least inflection of the exterior tentacles. Again, when a bit of meat is placed on the gland of an exterior tentacle, I have seen movement in ten seconds, and repeatedly within a minute; but a much larger bit placed on several glands on the disc does not cause [page 235] the exterior tentacles to bend until half an hour or even several hours have elapsed. The motor impulse spreads gradually on all sides from one or more excited glands, so that the tentacles which stand nearest are always first affected. Hence, when the glands in the centre of the disc are excited, the extreme marginal tentacles are the last inflected. But the glands on different parts of the leaf transmit their motor power in a somewhat different manner. If a bit of meat be placed on the long-headed gland of a marginal tentacle, it quickly transmits an impulse to its own bending portion; but never, as far as I have observed, to the adjoining tentacles; for these are not affected until the meat has been carried to the central glands, which then radiate forth their conjoint impulse on all sides. On four occasions leaves were prepared by removing some days previously all the glands from the centre, so that these could not be excited by the bits of meat brought to them by the inflection of the marginal tentacles; and now these marginal tentacles re-expanded after a time without any other tentacle being affected. Other leaves were similarly prepared, and bits of meat were placed on the glands of two tentacles in the third row from the outside, and on the glands of two tentacles in the fifth row. In these four cases the impulse was sent in the first place laterally, that is, in the same concentric row of tentacles, and then towards the centre; but not centrifugally, or towards the exterior tentacles. In one of these cases only a single tentacle on each side of the one with meat was affected. In the three other cases, from half a dozen to a dozen tentacles, both laterally and towards the centre, were well inflected or sub-inflected. Lastly, in [page 236] ten other experiments, minute bits of meat were placed on a single gland or on two glands in the centre of the disc. In order that no other glands should touch the meat, through the inflection of the closely adjoining short tentacles, about half a dozen glands had been previously removed round the selected ones. On eight of these leaves from sixteen to twenty-five of the short surrounding tentacles were inflected in the course of one or two days; so that the motor impulse radiating from one or two of the discal glands is able to produce this much effect. The tentacles which had been removed are included in the above numbers; for, from standing so close, they would certainly have been affected. On the two remaining leaves, almost all the short tentacles on the disc were inflected. With a more powerful stimulus than meat, namely a little phosphate of lime moistened with saliva, I have seen the inflection spread still farther from a single gland thus treated; but even in this case the three or four outer rows of tentacles were not affected. From these experiments it appears that the impulse from a single gland on the disc acts on a greater number of tentacles than that from a gland of one of the exterior elongated tentacles; and this probably follows, at least in part, from the impulse having to travel a very short distance down the pedicels of the central tentacles, so that it is able to spread to a considerable distance all round. Whilst examining these leaves, I was struck with the fact that in six, perhaps seven, of them the tentacles were much more inflected at the distal and proximal ends of the leaf (i.e. towards the apex and base) than on either side; and yet the tentacles on the sides stood as near to the gland where the bit of meat lay as did those at the two ends. It thus appeared as [page 237] if the motor impulse was transmitted from the centre across the disc more readily in a longitudinal than in a transverse direction; and as this appeared a new and interesting fact in the physiology of plants, thirty-five fresh experiments were made to test its truth. Minute bits of meat were placed on a single gland or on a few glands, on the right or left side of the discs of eighteen leaves; other bits of the same size being placed on the distal or proximal ends of seventeen other leaves. Now if the motor impulse were transmitted with equal force or at an equal rate through the blade in all directions, a bit of meat placed at one side or at one end of the disc ought to affect equally all the tentacles situated at an equal distance from it; but this certainly is not the case. Before giving the general results, it may be well to describe three or four rather unusual cases. [(1) A minute fragment of a fly was placed on one side of the disc, and after 32 m. seven of the outer tentacles near the fragment were inflected; after 10 hrs. several more became so, and after 23 hrs. a still greater number; and now the blade of the leaf on this side was bent inwards so as to stand up at right angles to the other side. Neither the blade of the leaf nor a single tentacle on the opposite side was affected; the line of separation between the two halves extending from the footstalk to the apex. The leaf remained in this state for three days, and on the fourth day began to re-expand; not a single tentacle having been inflected on the opposite side. (2) I will here give a case not included in the above thirty-five experiments. A small fly was found adhering by its feet to the left side of the disc. The tentacles on this side soon closed in and killed the fly; and owing probably to its struggle whilst alive, the leaf was so much excited that in about 24 hrs. all the tentacles on the opposite side became inflected; but as they found no prey, for their glands did not reach the fly, they re-expanded in the course of 15 hrs.; the tentacles on the left side remaining clasped for several days. (3) A bit of meat, rather larger than those commonly used, [page 238] was placed in a medial line at the basal end of the disc, near the footstalk; after 2 hrs. 30 m. some neighbouring tentacles were inflected; after 6 hrs. the tentacles on both sides of the footstalk, and some way up both sides, were moderately inflected; after 8 hrs. the tentacles at the further or distal end were more inflected than those on either side; after 23 hrs. the meat was well clasped by all the tentacles, excepting by the exterior ones on the two sides. (4) Another bit of meat was placed at the opposite or distal end of another leaf, with exactly the same relative results. (5) A minute bit of meat was placed on one side of the disc; next day the neighbouring short tentacles were inflected, as well as in a slight degree three or four on the opposite side near the footstalk. On the second day these latter tentacles showed signs of re-expanding, so I added a fresh bit of meat at nearly the same spot, and after two days some of the short tentacles on the opposite side of the disc were inflected. As soon as these began to re-expand, I added another bit of meat, and next day all the tentacles on the opposite side of the disc were inflected towards the meat; whereas we have seen that those on the same side were affected by the first bit of meat which was given.] Now for the general results. Of the eighteen leaves on which bits of meat were placed on the right or left sides of the disc, eight had a vast number of tentacles inflected on the same side, and in four of them the blade itself on this side was likewise inflected; whereas not a single tentacle nor the blade was affected on the opposite side. These leaves presented a very curious appearance, as if only the inflected side was active, and the other paralysed. In the remaining ten cases, a few tentacles became inflected beyond the medial line, on the side opposite to that where the meat lay; but, in some of these cases, only at the proximal or distal ends of the leaves. The inflection on the opposite side always occurred considerably after that on the same side, and in one instance not until the fourth day. We have also seen [page 239] with No. 5 that bits of meat had to be added thrice before all the short tentacles on the opposite side of the disc were inflected. The result was widely different when bits of meat were placed in a medial line at the distal or proximal ends of the disc. In three of the seventeen experiments thus made, owing either to the state of the leaf or to the smallness of the bit of meat, only the immediately adjoining tentacles were affected; but in the other fourteen cases the tentacles at the opposite end of the leaf were inflected, though these were as distant from where the meat lay as were those on one side of the disc from the meat on the opposite side. In some of the present cases the tentacles on the sides were not at all affected, or in a less degree, or after a longer interval of time, than those at the opposite end. One set of experiments is worth giving in fuller detail. Cubes of meat, not quite so small as those usually employed, were placed on one side of the discs of four leaves, and cubes of the same size at the proximal or distal end of four other leaves. Now, when these two sets of leaves were compared after an interval of 24 hrs., they presented a striking difference. Those having the cubes on one side were very slightly affected on the opposite side; whereas those with the cubes at either end had almost every tentacle at the opposite end, even the marginal ones, closely inflected. After 48 hrs. the contrast in the state of the two sets was still great; yet those with the meat on one side now had their discal and submarginal tentacles on the opposite side somewhat inflected, this being due to the large size of the cubes. Finally we may conclude from these thirty-five experiments, not to mention the six or seven previous ones, that the motor impulse is transmitted from any single gland [page 240] or small group of glands through the blade to the other tentacles more readily and effectually in a longitudinal than in a transverse direction. As long as the glands remain excited, and this may last for many days, even for eleven, as when in contact with phosphate of lime, they continue to transmit a motor impulse to the basal and bending parts of their own pedicels, for otherwise they would re-expand. The great difference in the length of time during which tentacles remain inflected over inorganic objects, and over objects of the same size containing soluble nitrogenous matter, proves the same fact. But the intensity of the impulse transmitted from an excited gland, which has begun to pour forth its acid secretion and is at the same time absorbing, seems to be very small compared with that which it transmits when first excited. Thus, when moderately large bits of meat were placed on one side of the disc, and the discal and sub-marginal tentacles on the opposite side became inflected, so that their glands at last touched the meat and absorbed matter from it, they did not transmit any motor influence to the exterior rows of tentacles on the same side, for these never became inflected. If, however, meat had been placed on the glands of these same tentacles before they had begun to secrete copiously and to absorb, they undoubtedly would have affected the exterior rows. Nevertheless, when I gave some phosphate of lime, which is a most powerful stimulant, to several submarginal tentacles already considerably inflected, but not yet in contact with some phosphate previously placed on two glands in the centre of the disc, the exterior tentacles on the same side were acted on. When a gland is first excited, the motor impulse is discharged within a few seconds, as we know from the [page 241] bending of the tentacle; and it appears to be discharged at first with much greater force than afterwards. Thus, in the case above given of a small fly naturally caught by a few glands on one side of a leaf, an impulse was slowly transmitted from them across the whole breadth of the leaf, causing the opposite tentacles to be temporarily inflected, but the glands which remained in contact with the insect, though they continued for several days to send an impulse down their own pedicels to the bending place, did not prevent the tentacles on the opposite side from quickly re-expanding; so that the motor discharge must at first have been more powerful than afterwards. When an object of any kind is placed on the disc, and the surrounding tentacles are inflected, their glands secrete more copiously and the secretion becomes acid, so that some influence is sent to them from the discal glands. This change in the nature and amount of the secretion cannot depend on the bending of the tentacles, as the glands of the short central tentacles secrete acid when an object is placed on them, though they do not themselves bend. Therefore I inferred that the glands of the disc sent some influence up the surrounding tentacles to their glands, and that these reflected back a motor impulse to their basal parts; but this view was soon proved erroneous. It was found by many trials that tentacles with their glands closely cut off by sharp scissors often become inflected and again re-expand, still appearing healthy. One which was observed continued healthy for ten days after the operation. I therefore cut the glands off twenty-five tentacles, at different times and on different leaves, and seventeen of these soon became inflected, and afterwards re-expanded. The re-expansion commenced in about [page 242] 8 hrs. or 9 hrs., and was completed in from 22 hrs. to 30 hrs. from the time of inflection. After an interval of a day or two, raw meat with saliva was placed on the discs of these seventeen leaves, and when observed next day, seven of the headless tentacles were inflected over the meat as closely as the uninjured ones on the same leaves; and an eighth headless tentacle became inflected after three additional days. The meat was removed from one of these leaves, and the surface washed with a little stream of water, and after three days the headless tentacle re-expanded for the second time. These tentacles without glands were, however, in a different state from those provided with glands and which had absorbed matter from the meat, for the protoplasm within the cells of the former had undergone far less aggregation. From these experiments with headless tentacles it is certain that the glands do not, as far as the motor impulse is concerned, act in a reflex manner like the nerve-ganglia of animals. But there is another action, namely that of aggregation, which in certain cases may be called reflex, and it is the only known instance in the vegetable kingdom. We should bear in mind that the process does not depend on the previous bending of the tentacles, as we clearly see when leaves are immersed in certain strong solutions. Nor does it depend on increased secretion from the glands, and this is shown by several facts, more especially by the papillae, which do not secrete, yet undergoing aggregation, if given carbonate of ammonia or an infusion of raw meat. When a gland is directly stimulated in any way, as by the pressure of a minute particle of glass, the protoplasm within the cells of the gland first becomes aggregated, then that in the cells immediately beneath the gland, and so lower and lower down the tentacles to their bases;— [page 243] that is, if the stimulus has been sufficient and not injurious. Now, when the glands of the disc are excited, the exterior tentacles are affected in exactly the same manner: the aggregation always commences in their glands, though these have not been directly excited, but have only received some influence from the disc, as shown by their increased acid secretion. The protoplasm within the cells immediately beneath the glands are next affected, and so downwards from cell to cell to the bases of the tentacles. This process apparently deserves to be called a reflex action, in the same manner as when a sensory nerve is irritated, and carries an impression to a ganglion which sends back some influence to a muscle or gland, causing movement or increased secretion; but the action in the two cases is probably of a widely different nature. After the protoplasm in a tentacle has been aggregated, its redissolution always begins in the lower part, and slowly travels up the pedicel to the gland, so that the protoplasm last aggregated is first redissolved. This probably depends merely on the protoplasm being less and less aggregated, lower and lower down in the tentacles, as can be seen plainly when the excitement has been slight. As soon, therefore, as the aggregating action altogether ceases, redissolution naturally commences in the less strongly aggregated matter in the lowest part of the tentacle, and is there first completed. Direction of the Inflected Tentacles.—When a particle of any kind is placed on the gland of one of the outer tentacles, this invariably moves towards the centre of the leaf; and so it is with all the tentacles of a leaf immersed in any exciting fluid. The glands of the exterior tentacles then form a ring round the middle part of the disc, as shown in a previous figure (fig. 4, [page 244] p. 10). The short tentacles within this ring still retain their vertical position, as they likewise do when a large object is placed on their glands, or when an insect is caught by them. In this latter case we can see that the inflection of the short central tentacles would be useless, as their glands are already in contact with their prey. FIG. 10. (Drosera rotundifolia.) Leaf (enlarged) with the tentacles inflected over a bit of meat placed on one side of the disc. The result is very different when a single gland on one side of the disc is excited, or a few in a group. These send an impulse to the surrounding tentacles, which do not now bend towards the centre of the leaf, but to the point of excitement. We owe this capital observation to Nitschke,* and since reading his paper a few years ago, I have repeatedly verified it. If a minute bit of meat be placed by the aid of a needle on a single gland, or on three or four together, halfway between the centre and the circumference of the disc, the directed movement of the surrounding tentacles is well exhibited. An accurate drawing of a leaf with meat in this position is here reproduced (fig. 10), and we see the tentacles, including some of the exterior ones, accurately directed to the point where the meat lay. But a much better * ‘Bot. Zeitung,’ 1860, p. 240. [page 245] plan is to place a particle of the phosphate of lime moistened with saliva on a single gland on one side of the disc of a large leaf, and another particle on a single gland on the opposite side. In four such trials the excitement was not sufficient to affect the outer tentacles, but all those near the two points were directed to them, so that two wheels were formed on the disc of the same leaf; the pedicels of the tentacles forming the spokes, and the glands united in a mass over the phosphate representing the axles. The precision with which each tentacle pointed to the particle was wonderful; so that in some cases I could detect no deviation from perfect accuracy. Thus, although the short tentacles in the middle of the disc do not bend when their glands are excited in a direct manner, yet if they receive a motor impulse from a point on one side, they direct themselves to the point equally well with the tentacles on the borders of the disc. In these experiments, some of the short tentacles on the disc, which would have been directed to the centre, had the leaf been immersed in an exciting fluid, were now inflected in an exactly opposite direction, viz. towards the circumference. These tentacles, therefore, had deviated as much as 180o from the direction which they would have assumed if their own glands had been stimulated, and which may be considered as the normal one. Between this, the greatest possible and no deviation from the normal direction, every degree could be observed in the tentacles on these several leaves. Notwithstanding the precision with which the tentacles generally were directed, those near the circumference of one leaf were not accurately directed towards some phosphate of lime at a rather distant point on the opposite side of the disc. It appeared as if the motor [page 246] impulse in passing transversely across nearly the whole width of the disc had departed somewhat from a true course. This accords with what we have already seen of the impulse travelling less readily in a transverse than in a longitudinal direction. In some other cases, the exterior tentacles did not seem capable of such accurate movement as the shorter and more central ones. Nothing could be more striking than the appearance of the above four leaves, each with their tentacles pointing truly to the two little masses of the phosphate on their discs. We might imagine that we were looking at a lowly organised animal seizing prey with its arms. In the case of Drosera the explanation of this accurate power of movement, no doubt, lies in the motor impulse radiating in all directions, and whichever side of a tentacle it first strikes, that side contracts, and the tentacle consequently bends towards the point of excitement. The pedicels of the tentacles are flattened, or elliptic in section. Near the bases of the short central tentacles, the flattened or broad face is formed of about five longitudinal rows of cells; in the outer tentacles of the disc it consists of about six or seven rows; and in the extreme marginal tentacles of above a dozen rows. As the flattened bases are thus formed of only a few rows of cells, the precision of the movements of the tentacles is the more remarkable; for when the motor impulse strikes the base of a tentacle in a very oblique direction relatively to its broad face, scarcely more than one or two cells towards one end can be affected at first, and the contraction of these cells must draw the whole tentacle into the proper direction. It is, perhaps, owing to the exterior pedicels being much flattened that they do not bend quite so accurately to the point of excitement as the [page 247] more central ones. The properly directed movement of the tentacles is not an unique case in the vegetable kingdom, for the tendrils of many plants curve towards the side which is touched; but the case of Drosera is far more interesting, as here the tentacles are not directly excited, but receive an impulse from a distant point; nevertheless, they bend accurately towards this point. FIG. 11. (Drosera rotundifolia.) Diagram showing the distribution of the vascular tissue in a small leaf. On the Nature of the Tissues through which the Motor Impulse is Transmitted.—It will be necessary first to describe briefly the course of the main fibro-vascular bundles. These are shown in the accompanying sketch (fig. 11) of a small leaf. Little vessels from the neighbouring bundles enter all the many tentacles with which the surface is studded; but these are not here represented. The central trunk, which runs up the footstalk, bifurcates near the centre of the leaf, each branch bifurcating again and again according to the size of the leaf. This central trunk sends off, low down on each side, a delicate branch, which may be called the sublateral branch. There is also, on each side, a main lateral branch or bundle, which bifurcates in the same manner as the others. Bifurcation does not imply that any single vessel divides, but that a bundle [page 248] divides into two. By looking to either side of the leaf, it will be seen that a branch from the great central bifurcation inosculates with a branch from the lateral bundle, and that there is a smaller inosculation between the two chief branches of the lateral bundle. The course of the vessels is very complex at the larger inosculation; and here vessels, retaining the same diameter, are often formed by the union of the bluntly pointed ends of two vessels, but whether these points open into each other by their attached surfaces, I do not know. By means of the two inosculations all the vessels on the same side of the leaf are brought into some sort of connection. Near the circumference of the larger leaves the bifurcating branches also come into close union, and then separate again, forming a continuous zigzag line of vessels round the whole circumference. But the union of the vessels in this zigzag line seems to be much less intimate than at the main inosculation. It should be added that the course of the vessels differs somewhat in different leaves, and even on opposite sides of the same leaf, but the main inosculation is always present. Now in my first experiments with bits of meat placed on one side of the disc, it so happened that not a single tentacle was inflected on the opposite side; and when I saw that the vessels on the same side were all connected together by the two inosculations, whilst not a vessel passed over to the opposite side, it seemed probable that the motor impulse was conducted exclusively along them. In order to test this view, I divided transversely with the point of a lancet the central trunks of four leaves, just beneath the main bifurcation; and two days afterwards placed rather large bits of raw meat [page 249] (a most powerful stimulant) near the centre of the disc above the incision—that is, a little towards the apex—with the following results:— [(1) This leaf proved rather torpid: after 4 hrs. 40 m. (in all cases reckoning from the time when the meat was given) the tentacles at the distal end were a little inflected, but nowhere else; they remained so for three days, and re-expanded on the fourth day. The leaf was then dissected, and the trunk, as well as the two sublateral branches, were found divided. (2) After 4 hrs. 30 m. many of the tentacles at the distal end were well inflected. Next day the blade and all the tentacles at this end were strongly inflected, and were separated by a distinct transverse line from the basal half of the leaf, which was not in the least affected. On the third day, however, some of the short tentacles on the disc near the base were very slightly inflected. The incision was found on dissection to extend across the leaf as in the last case. (3) After 4 hrs. 30 m. strong inflection of the tentacles at the distal end, which during the next two days never extended in the least to the basal end. The incision as before. (4) This leaf was not observed until 15 hrs. had elapsed, and then all the tentacles, except the extreme marginal ones, were found equally well inflected all round the leaf. On careful examination the spiral vessels of the central trunk were certainly divided; but the incision on one side had not passed through the fibrous tissue surrounding these vessels, though it had passed through the tissue on the other side.*] The appearance presented by the leaves (2) and (3) was very curious, and might be aptly compared with that of a man with his backbone broken and lower extremities paralysed. Excepting that the line between the two halves was here transverse instead of longitudinal, these leaves were in the same state as some of those in the former experiments, with bits of meat placed on one side of the disc. The case of leaf (4) * M. Ziegler made similar experiments by cutting the spiral vessels of Drosera intermedia(‘Comptes rendus,’ 1874, p. 1417), but arrived at conclusions widely different from mine. [page 250] proves that the spiral vessels of the central trunk may be divided, and yet the motor impulse be transmitted from the distal to the basal end; and this led me at first to suppose that the motor force was sent through the closely surrounding fibrous tissue; and that if one half of this tissue was left undivided, it sufficed for complete transmission. But opposed to this conclusion is the fact that no vessels pass directly from one side of the leaf to the other, and yet, as we have seen, if a rather large bit of meat is placed on one side, the motor impulse is sent, though slowly and imperfectly, in a transverse direction across the whole breadth of the leaf. Nor can this latter fact be accounted for by supposing that the transmission is effected through the two inosculations, or through the circumferential zigzag line of union, for had this been the case, the exterior tentacles on the opposite side of the disc would have been affected before the more central ones, which never occurred. We have also seen that the extreme marginal tentacles appear to have no power to transmit an impulse to the adjoining tentacles; yet the little bundle of vessels which enters each marginal tentacle sends off a minute branch to those on both sides, and this I have not observed in any other tentacles; so that the marginal ones are more closely connected together by spiral vessels than are the others, and yet have much less power of communicating a motor impulse to one another. But besides these several facts and arguments we have conclusive evidence that the motor impulse is not sent, at least exclusively, through the spiral vessels, or through the tissue immediately surrounding them. We know that if a bit of meat is placed on a gland (the immediately adjoining ones having been removed) on any part of the disc, all the short sur- [page 251] rounding tentacles bend almost simultaneously with great precision towards it. Now there are tentacles on the disc, for instance near the extremities of the sublateral bundles (fig. 11), which are supplied with vessels that do not come into contact with the branches that enter the surrounding tentacles, except by a very long and extremely circuitous course. Nevertheless, if a bit of meat is placed on the gland of a tentacle of this kind, all the surrounding ones are inflected towards it with great precision. It is, of course, possible that an impulse might be sent through a long and circuitous course, but it is obviously impossible that the direction of the movement could be thus communicated, so that all the surrounding tentacles should bend precisely to the point of excitement. The impulse no doubt is transmitted in straight radiating lines from the excited gland to the surrounding tentacles; it cannot, therefore, be sent along the fibro-vascular bundles. The effect of cutting the central vessels, in the above cases, in preventing the transmission of the motor impulse from the distal to the basal end of a leaf, may be attributed to a considerable space of the cellular tissue having been divided. We shall hereafter see, when we treat of Dionaea, that this same conclusion, namely that the motor impulse is not transmitted by the fibro-vascular bundles, is plainly confirmed; and Prof. Cohn has come to the same conclusion with respect to Aldrovanda—both members of the Droseraceae. As the motor impulse is not transmitted along the vessels, there remains for its passage only the cellular tissue; and the structure of this tissue explains to a certain extent how it travels so quickly down the long exterior tentacles, and much more slowly across the blade of the leaf. We shall also see why it crosses [page 252] the blade more quickly in a longitudinal than in a transverse direction; though with time it can pass in any direction. We know that the same stimulus causes movement of the tentacles and aggregation of the protoplasm, and that both influences originate in and proceed from the glands within the same brief space of time. It seems therefore probable that the motor impulse consists of the first commencement of a molecular change in the protoplasm, which, when well developed, is plainly visible, and has been designated aggregation; but to this subject I shall return. We further know that in the transmission of the aggregating process the chief delay is caused by the passage of the transverse cell-walls; for as the aggregation travels down the tentacles, the contents of each successive cell seem almost to flash into a cloudy mass. We may therefore infer that the motor impulse is in like manner delayed chiefly by passing through the cell-walls. The greater celerity with which the impulse is transmitted down the long exterior tentacles than across the disc may be largely attributed to its being closely confined within the narrow pedicel, instead of radiating forth on all sides as on the disc. But besides this confinement, the exterior cells of the tentacles are fully twice as long as those of the disc; so that only half the number of transverse partitions have to be traversed in a given length of a tentacle, compared with an equal space on the disc; and there would be in the same proportion less retardation of the impulse. Moreover, in sections of the exterior tentacles given by Dr. Warming,* the parenchymatous * ‘Videnskabelige Meddelelser de la Soc. d’Hist. nat. de Copenhague,’ Nos. 10-12, 1872, woodcuts iv. and v. [page 253] cells are shown to be still more elongated; and these would form the most direct line of communication from the gland to the bending place of the tentacle. If the impulse travels down the exterior cells, it would have to cross from between twenty to thirty transverse partitions; but rather fewer if down the inner parenchymatous tissue. In either case it is remarkable that the impulse is able to pass through so many partitions down nearly the whole length of the pedicel, and to act on the bending place, in ten seconds. Why the impulse, after having passed so quickly down one of the extreme marginal tentacles (about 1/20 of an inch in length), should never, as far as I have seen, affect the adjoining tentacles, I do not understand. It may be in part accounted for by much energy being expended in the rapidity of the transmission. Most of the cells of the disc, both the superficial ones and the larger cells which form the five or six underlying layers, are about four times as long as broad. They are arranged almost longitudinally, radiating from the footstalk. The motor impulse, therefore, when transmitted across the disc, has to cross nearly four times as many cell-walls as when transmitted in a longitudinal direction, and would consequently be much delayed in the former case. The cells of the disc converge towards the bases of the tentacles, and are thus fitted to convey the motor impulse to them from all sides. On the whole, the arrangement and shape of the cells, both those of the disc and tentacles, throw much light on the rate and manner of diffusion of the motor impulse. But why the impulse proceeding from the glands of the exterior rows of tentacles tends to travel laterally and towards the centre of the leaf, but not centrifugally, is by no means clear. [page 254] Mechanism of the Movements, and Nature of the Motor Impulse.—Whatever may be the means of movement, the exterior tentacles, considering their delicacy, are inflected with much force. A bristle, held so that a length of 1 inch projected from a handle, yielded when I tried to lift with it an inflected tentacle, which was somewhat thinner than the bristle. The amount or extent, also, of the movement is great. Fully expanded tentacles in becoming inflected sweep through an angle of 180o; and if they are beforehand reflexed, as often occurs, the angle is considerably greater. It is probably the superficial cells at the bending place which chiefly or exclusively contract; for the interior cells have very delicate walls, and are so few in number that they could hardly cause a tentacle to bend with precision to a definite point. Though I carefully looked, I could never detect any wrinkling of the surface at the bending place, even in the case of a tentacle abnormally curved into a complete circle, under circumstances hereafter to be mentioned. All the cells are not acted on, though the motor impulse passes through them. When the gland of one of the long exterior tentacles is excited, the upper cells are not in the least affected; about halfway down there is a slight bending, but the chief movement is confined to a short space near the base; and no part of the inner tentacles bends except the basal portion. With respect to the blade of the leaf, the motor impulse may be transmitted through many cells, from the centre to the circumference, without their being in the least affected, or they may be strongly acted on and the blade greatly inflected. In the latter case the movement seems to depend partly on the strength of the stimulus, and partly on [page 255] its nature, as when leaves are immersed in certain fluids. The power of movement which various plants possess, when irritated, has been attributed by high authorities to the rapid passage of fluid out of certain cells, which, from their previous state of tension, immediately contract.* Whether or not this is the primary cause of such movements, fluid must pass out of closed cells when they contract or are pressed together in one direction, unless they at the same time expand in some other direction. For instance, fluid can be seen to ooze from the surface of any young and vigorous shoot if slowly bent into a semi-circle.** In the case of Drosera there is certainly much movement of the fluid throughout the tentacles whilst they are undergoing inflection. Many leaves can be found in which the purple fluid within the cells is of an equally dark tint on the upper and lower sides of the tentacles, extending also downwards on both sides to equally near their bases. If the tentacles of such a leaf are excited into movement, it will generally be found after some hours that the cells on the concave side are much paler than they were before, or are quite colourless, those on the convex side having become much darker. In two instances, after particles of hair had been placed on glands, and when in the course of 1 hr. 10 m. the tentacles were incurved halfway towards the centre of the leaf, this change of colour in the two sides was conspicuously plain. In another case, after a bit of meat had been placed on a gland, the purple colour was observed at intervals to be slowly travelling from the upper to the lower part, down the convex side of * Sachs, ‘Traité de Bot.’ 3rd edit. 1874, p. 1038. This view was, I believe, first suggested by Lamarck. ** Sachs, ibid. p. 919. [page 256] the bending tentacle. But it does not follow from these observations that the cells on the convex side become filled with more fluid during the act of inflection than they contained before; for fluid may all the time be passing into the disc or into the glands which then secrete freely. The bending of the tentacles, when leaves are immersed in a dense fluid, and their subsequent re-expansion in a less dense fluid, show that the passage of fluid from or into the cells can cause movements like the natural ones. But the inflection thus caused is often irregular; the exterior tentacles being sometimes spirally curved. Other unnatural movements are likewise caused by the application of dense fluids, as in the case of drops of syrup placed on the backs of leaves and tentacles. Such movements may be compared with the contortions which many vegetable tissues undergo when subjected to exosmose. It is therefore doubtful whether they throw any light on the natural movements. If we admit that the outward passage of fluid is the cause of the bending of the tentacles, we must suppose that the cells, before the act of inflection, are in a high state of tension, and that they are elastic to an extraordinary degree; for otherwise their contraction could not cause the tentacles often to sweep through an angle of above 180o. Prof. Cohn, in his interesting paper* on the movements of the stamens of certain Compositae, states that these organs, when dead, are as elastic as threads of india-rubber, and are then only half as long as they were when alive. He believes that the living protoplasm * ‘Abhand. der Schles. Gesell. fr vaterl. Cultur,’ 1861, Heft i. An excellent abstract of this paper is given in the ‘Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.’ 3rd series, 1863, vol. xi. pp. 188-197. [page 257] within their cells is ordinarily in a state of expansion, but is paralysed by irritation, or may be said to suffer temporary death; the elasticity of the cell-walls then coming into play, and causing the contraction of the stamens. Now the cells on the upper or concave side of the bending part of the tentacles of Drosera do not appear to be in a state of tension, nor to be highly elastic; for when a leaf is suddenly killed, or dies slowly, it is not the upper but the lower sides of the tentacles which contract from elasticity. We may, therefore, conclude that their movements cannot be accounted for by the inherent elasticity of certain cells, opposed as long as they are alive and not irritated by the expanded state of their contents. A somewhat different view has been advanced by other physiologists—namely that the protoplasm, when irritated, contracts like the soft sarcode of the muscles of animals. In Drosera the fluid within the cells of the tentacles at the bending place appears under the microscope thin and homogeneous, and after aggregation consists of small, soft masses of matter, undergoing incessant changes of form and floating in almost colourless fluid. These masses are completely redissolved when the tentacles re-expand. Now it seems scarcely possible that such matter should have any direct mechanical power; but if through some molecular change it were to occupy less space than it did before, no doubt the cell-walls would close up and contract. But in this case it might be expected that the walls would exhibit wrinkles, and none could ever be seen. Moreover, the contents of all the cells seem to be of exactly the same nature, both before and after aggregation; and yet only a few of the basal cells contract, the rest of the tentacle remaining straight. A third view maintained by some physiologists, [page 258] though rejected by most others, is that the whole cell, including the walls, actively contracts. If the walls are composed solely of non-nitrogenous cellulose, this view is highly improbable; but it can hardly be doubted that they must be permeated by proteid matter, at least whilst they are growing. Nor does there seem any inherent improbability in the cell-walls of Drosera contracting, considering their high state of organisation; as shown in the case of the glands by their power of absorption and secretion, and by being exquisitely sensitive so as to be affected by the pressure of the most minute particles. The cell-walls of the pedicels also allow various impulses to pass through them, inducing movement, increased secretion and aggregation. On the whole the belief that the walls of certain cells contract, some of their contained fluid being at the same time forced outwards, perhaps accords best with the observed facts. If this view is rejected, the next most probable one is that the fluid contents of the cells shrink, owing to a change in their molecular state, with the consequent closing in of the walls. Anyhow, the movement can hardly be attributed to the elasticity of the walls, together with a previous state of tension. With respect to the nature of the motor impulse which is transmitted from the glands down the pedicels and across the disc, it seems not improbable that it is closely allied to that influence which causes the protoplasm within the cells of the glands and tentacles to aggregate. We have seen that both forces originate in and proceed from the glands within a few seconds of the same time, and are excited by the same causes. The aggregation of the protoplasm lasts almost as long as the tentacles remain inflected, even though this be for more than a week; but the [page 259] protoplasm is redissolved at the bending place shortly before the tentacles re-expand, showing that the exciting cause of the aggregating process has then quite ceased. Exposure to carbonic acid causes both the latter process and the motor impulse to travel very slowly down the tentacles. We know that the aggregating process is delayed in passing through the cell- walls, and we have good reason to believe that this holds good with the motor impulse; for we can thus understand the different rates of its transmission in a longitudinal and transverse line across the disc. Under a high power the first sign of aggregation is the appearance of a cloud, and soon afterwards of extremely fine granules, in the homogeneous purple fluid within the cells; and this apparently is due to the union of molecules of protoplasm. Now it does not seem an improbable view that the same tendency—namely for the molecules to approach each other—should be communicated to the inner surfaces of the cell-walls which are in contact with the protoplasm; and if so, their molecules would approach each other, and the cell-wall would contract. To this view it may with truth be objected that when leaves are immersed in various strong solutions, or are subjected to a heat of above 130° Fahr. (54°.4 Cent.), aggregation ensues, but there is no movement. Again, various acids and some other fluids cause rapid movement, but no aggregation, or only of an abnormal nature, or only after a long interval of time; but as most of these fluids are more or less injurious, they may check or prevent the aggregating process by injuring or killing the protoplasm. There is another and more important difference in the two processes: when the glands on the disc are excited, they transmit some influence up the surrounding [page 260] tentacles, which acts on the cells at the bending place, but does not induce aggregation until it has reached the glands; these then send back some other influence, causing the protoplasm to aggregate, first in the upper and then in the lower cells. The Re-expansion of the Tentacles.—This movement is always slow and gradual. When the centre of the leaf is excited, or a leaf is immersed in a proper solution, all the tentacles bend directly towards the centre, and afterwards directly back from it. But when the point of excitement is on one side of the disc, the surrounding tentacles bend towards it, and therefore obliquely with respect to their normal direction; when they afterwards re-expand, they bend obliquely back, so as to recover their original positions. The tentacles farthest from an excited point, wherever that may be, are the last and the least affected, and probably in consequence of this they are the first to re-expand. The bent portion of a closely inflected tentacle is in a state of active contraction, as shown by the following experiment. Meat was placed on a leaf, and after the tentacles were closely inflected and had quite ceased to move, narrow strips of the disc, with a few of the outer tentacles attached to it, were cut off and laid on one side under the microscope. After several failures, I succeeded in cutting off the convex surface of the bent portion of a tentacle. Movement immediately recommenced, and the already greatly bent portion went on bending until it formed a perfect circle; the straight distal portion of the tentacle passing on one side of the strip. The convex surface must therefore have previously been in a state of tension, sufficient to counter-balance that of the concave surface, which, when free, curled into a complete ring. The tentacles of an expanded and unexcited leaf [page 261] are moderately rigid and elastic; if bent by a needle, the upper end yields more easily than the basal and thicker part, which alone is capable of becoming inflected. The rigidity of this basal part seems due to the tension of the outer surface balancing a state of active and persistent contraction of the cells of the inner surface. I believe that this is the case, because, when a leaf is dipped into boiling water, the tentacles suddenly become reflexed, and this apparently indicates that the tension of the outer surface is mechanical, whilst that of the inner surface is vital, and is instantly destroyed by the boiling water. We can thus also understand why the tentacles as they grow old and feeble slowly become much reflexed. If a leaf with its tentacles closely inflected is dipped into boiling water, these rise up a little, but by no means fully re-expand. This may be owing to the heat quickly destroying the tension and elasticity of the cells of the convex surface; but I can hardly believe that their tension, at any one time, would suffice to carry back the tentacles to their original position, often through an angle of above 180o. It is more probable that fluid, which we know travels along the tentacles during the act of inflection, is slowly re-attracted into the cells of the convex surface, their tension being thus gradually and continually increased. A recapitulation of the chief facts and discussions in this chapter will be given at the close of the next chapter. [page 262] ',\n",
              " 'XI. RECAPITULATION OF THE CHIEF OBSERVATIONS ON DROSERA ROTUNDIFOLIA. As summaries have been given to most of the chapters, it will be sufficient here to recapitulate, as briefly as I can, the chief points. In the first chapter a preliminary sketch was given of the structure of the leaves, and of the manner in which they capture insects. This is effected by drops of extremely viscid fluid surrounding the glands and by the inward movement of the tentacles. As the plants gain most of their nutriment by this means, their roots are very poorly developed; and they often grow in places where hardly any other plant except mosses can exist. The glands have the power of absorption, besides that of secretion. They are extremely sensitive to various stimulants, namely repeated touches, the pressure of minute particles, the absorption of animal matter and of various fluids, heat, and galvanic action. A tentacle with a bit of raw meat on the gland has been seen to begin bending in 10 s., to be strongly incurved in 5 m., and to reach the centre of the leaf in half an hour. The blade of the leaf often becomes so much inflected that it forms a cup, enclosing any object placed on it. A gland, when excited, not only sends some influence down its own tentacle, causing it to bend, but likewise to the surrounding tentacles, which become incurved; so that the bending place can be acted on by an impulse received from opposite directions, [page 263] namely from the gland on the summit of the same tentacle, and from one or more glands of the neighbouring tentacles. Tentacles, when inflected, re-expand after a time, and during this process the glands secrete less copiously, or become dry. As soon as they begin to secrete again, the tentacles are ready to re-act; and this may be repeated at least three, probably many more times. It was shown in the second chapter that animal substances placed on the discs cause much more prompt and energetic inflection than do inorganic bodies of the same size, or mere mechanical irritation; but there is a still more marked difference in the greater length of time during which the tentacles remain inflected over bodies yielding soluble and nutritious matter, than over those which do not yield such matter. Extremely minute particles of glass, cinders, hair, thread, precipitated chalk, &c., when placed on the glands of the outer tentacles, cause them to bend. A particle, unless it sinks through the secretion and actually touches the surface of the gland with some one point, does not produce any effect. A little bit of thin human hair 8/1000 of an inch (.203 mm.) in length, and weighing only 1/78740 of a grain (.000822 mg.), though largely supported by the dense secretion, suffices to induce movement. It is not probable that the pressure in this case could have amounted to that from the millionth of a grain. Even smaller particles cause a slight movement, as could be seen through a lens. Larger particles than those of which the measurements have been given cause no sensation when placed on the tongue, one of the most sensitive parts of the human body. Movement ensues if a gland is momentarily touched three or four times; but if touched only once or twice, [page 264] though with considerable force and with a hard object, the tentacle does not bend. The plant is thus saved from much useless movement, as during a high wind the glands can hardly escape being occasionally brushed by the leaves of surrounding plants. Though insensible to a single touch, they are exquisitely sensitive, as just stated, to the slightest pressure if prolonged for a few seconds; and this capacity is manifestly of service to the plant in capturing small insects. Even gnats, if they rest on the glands with their delicate feet, are quickly and securely embraced. The glands are insensible to the weight and repeated blows of drops of heavy rain, and the plants are thus likewise saved from much useless movement. The description of the movements of the tentacles was interrupted in the third chapter for the sake of describing the process of aggregation. This process always commences in the cells of the glands, the contents of which first become cloudy; and this has been observed within 10 s. after a gland has been excited. Granules just resolvable under a very high power soon appear, sometimes within a minute, in the cells beneath the glands; and these then aggregate into minute spheres. The process afterwards travels down the tentacles, being arrested for a short time at each transverse partition. The small spheres coalesce into larger spheres, or into oval, club-headed, thread- or necklace-like, or otherwise shaped masses of protoplasm, which, suspended in almost colourless fluid, exhibit incessant spontaneous changes of form. These frequently coalesce and again separate. If a gland has been powerfully excited, all the cells down to the base of the tentacle are affected. In cells, especially if filled with dark red fluid, the first step in the [page 265] process often is the formation of a dark red, bag-like mass of protoplasm, which afterwards divides and undergoes the usual repeated changes of form. Before any aggregation has been excited, a sheet of colourless protoplasm, including granules (the primordial utricle of Mohl), flows round the walls of the cells; and this becomes more distinct after the contents have been partially aggregated into spheres or bag-like masses. But after a time the granules are drawn towards the central masses and unite with them; and then the circulating sheet can no longer be distinguished, but there is still a current of transparent fluid within the cells. Aggregation is excited by almost all the stimulants which induce movement; such as the glands being touched two or three times, the pressure of minute inorganic particles, the absorption of various fluids, even long immersion in distilled water, exosmose, and heat. Of the many stimulants tried, carbonate of ammonia is the most energetic and acts the quickest: a dose of 1/134400 of a grain (.00048 mg.) given to a single gland suffices to cause in one hour well-marked aggregation in the upper cells of the tentacle. The process goes on only as long as the protoplasm is in a living, vigorous, and oxygenated condition. The result is in all respects exactly the same, whether a gland has been excited directly, or has received an influence from other and distant glands. But there is one important difference: when the central glands are irritated, they transmit centrifugally an influence up the pedicels of the exterior tentacles to their glands; but the actual process of aggregation travels centripetally, from the glands of the exterior tentacles down their pedicels. The exciting influence, therefore, which is transmitted from [page 266] one part of the leaf to another must be different from that which actually induces aggregation. The process does not depend on the glands secreting more copiously than they did before; and is independent of the inflection of the tentacles. It continues as long as the tentacles remain inflected, and as soon as these are fully re-expanded, the little masses of protoplasm are all redissolved; the cells becoming filled with homogeneous purple fluid, as they were before the leaf was excited. As the process of aggregation can be excited by a few touches, or by the pressure of insoluble particles, it is evidently independent of the absorption of any matter, and must be of a molecular nature. Even when caused by the absorption of the carbonate or other salt of ammonia, or an infusion of meat, the process seems to be of exactly the same nature. The protoplasmic fluid must, therefore, be in a singularly unstable condition, to be acted on by such slight and varied causes. Physiologists believe that when a nerve is touched, and it transmits an influence to other parts of the nervous system, a molecular change is induced in it, though not visible to us. Therefore it is a very interesting spectacle to watch the effects on the cells of a gland, of the pressure of a bit of hair, weighing only 1/78700 of a grain and largely supported by the dense secretion, for this excessively slight pressure soon causes a visible change in the protoplasm, which change is transmitted down the whole length of the tentacle, giving it at last a mottled appearance, distinguishable even by the naked eye. In the fourth chapter it was shown that leaves placed for a short time in water at a temperature of 110° Fahr. (43°.3 Cent.) become somewhat inflected; they are thus also rendered more sensitive to the action [page 267] of meat than they were before. If exposed to a temperature of between 115° and 125°(46°.1-51°.6 Cent.), they are quickly inflected, and their protoplasm undergoes aggregation; when afterwards placed in cold water, they re-expand. Exposed to 130° (54°.4 Cent.), no inflection immediately occurs, but the leaves are only temporarily paralysed, for on being left in cold water, they often become inflected and afterwards re-expand. In one leaf thus treated, I distinctly saw the protoplasm in movement. In other leaves, treated in the same manner, and then immersed in a solution of carbonate of ammonia, strong aggregation ensued. Leaves placed in cold water, after an exposure to so high a temperature as 145° (62°.7 Cent.), sometimes become slightly, though slowly, inflected; and afterwards have the contents of their cells strongly aggregated by carbonate of ammonia. But the duration of the immersion is an important element, for if left in water at 145° (62°.7 Cent.), or only at 140° (60° Cent.), until it becomes cool, they are killed, and the contents of the glands are rendered white and opaque. This latter result seems to be due to the coagulation of the albumen, and was almost always caused by even a short exposure to 150° (65.5 Cent.); but different leaves, and even the separate cells in the same tentacle, differ considerably in their power of resisting heat. Unless the heat has been sufficient to coagulate the albumen, carbonate of ammonia subsequently induces aggregation. In the fifth chapter, the results of placing drops of various nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous organic fluids on the discs of leaves were given, and it was shown that they detect with almost unerring certainty the presence of nitrogen. A decoction of green peas or of fresh cabbage-leaves acts almost as powerfully as an infusion of raw meat; whereas an infusion of cabbage- [page 268] leaves made by keeping them for a long time in merely warm water is far less efficient. A decoction of grass-leaves is less powerful than one of green peas or cabbage-leaves. These results led me to inquire whether Drosera possessed the power of dissolving solid animal matter. The experiments proving that the leaves are capable of true digestion, and that the glands absorb the digested matter, are given in detail in the sixth chapter. These are, perhaps, the most interesting of all my observations on Drosera, as no such power was before distinctly known to exist in the vegetable kingdom. It is likewise an interesting fact that the glands of the disc, when irritated, should transmit some influence to the glands of the exterior tentacles, causing them to secrete more copiously and the secretion to become acid, as if they had been directly excited by an object placed on them. The gastric juice of animals contains, as is well known, an acid and a ferment, both of which are indispensable for digestion, and so it is with the secretion of Drosera. When the stomach of an animal is mechanically irritated, it secretes an acid, and when particles of glass or other such objects were placed on the glands of Drosera, the secretion, and that of the surrounding and untouched glands, was increased in quantity and became acid. But, according to Schiff, the stomach of an animal does not secrete its proper ferment, pepsin, until certain substances, which he calls peptogenes, are absorbed; and it appears from my experiments that some matter must be absorbed by the glands of Drosera before they secrete their proper ferment. That the secretion does contain a ferment which acts only in the presence of an acid on solid animal matter, was clearly proved by adding minute doses of [page 269] an alkali, which entirely arrested the process of digestion, this immediately recommencing as soon as the alkali was neutralised by a little weak hydrochloric acid. From trials made with a large number of substances, it was found that those which the secretion of Drosera dissolves completely, or partially, or not at all, are acted on in exactly the same manner by gastric juice. We may, therefore, conclude that the ferment of Drosera is closely analogous to, or identical with, the pepsin of animals. The substances which are digested by Drosera act on the leaves very differently. Some cause much more energetic and rapid inflection of the tentacles, and keep them inflected for a much longer time, than do others. We are thus led to believe that the former are more nutritious than the latter, as is known to be the case with some of these same substances when given to animals; for instance, meat in comparison with gelatine. As cartilage is so tough a substance and is so little acted on by water, its prompt dissolution by the secretion of Drosera, and subsequent absorption is, perhaps, one of the most striking cases. But it is not really more remarkable than the digestion of meat, which is dissolved by this secretion in the same manner and by the same stages as by gastric juice. The secretion dissolves bone, and even the enamel of teeth, but this is simply due to the large quantity of acid secreted, owing, apparently, to the desire of the plant for phosphorus. In the case of bone, the ferment does not come into play until all the phosphate of lime has been decomposed and free acid is present, and then the fibrous basis is quickly dissolved. Lastly, the secretion attacks and dissolves matter out of living seeds, which it sometimes kills, or injures, as shown by the diseased state [page 270] of the seedlings. It also absorbs matter from pollen, and from fragments of leaves. The seventh chapter was devoted to the action of the salts of ammonia. These all cause the tentacles, and often the blade of the leaf, to be inflected, and the protoplasm to be aggregated. They act with very different power; the citrate being the least powerful, and the phosphate, owing, no doubt, to the presence of phosphorus and nitrogen, by far the most powerful. But the relative efficiency of only three salts of ammonia was carefully determined, namely the carbonate, nitrate, and phosphate. The experiments were made by placing half-minims (.0296 ml.) of solutions of different strengths on the discs of the leaves,—by applying a minute drop (about the 1/20 of a minim, or .00296 ml.) for a few seconds to three or four glands,—and by the immersion of whole leaves in a measured quantity. In relation to these experiments it was necessary first to ascertain the effects of distilled water, and it was found, as described in detail, that the more sensitive leaves are affected by it, but only in a slight degree. A solution of the carbonate is absorbed by the roots and induces aggregation in their cells, but does not affect the leaves. The vapour is absorbed by the glands, and causes inflection as well as aggregation. A drop of a solution containing 1/960 of a grain (.0675 mg.) is the least quantity which, when placed on the glands of the disc, excites the exterior tentacles to bend inwards. But a minute drop, containing 1/14400 of a grain (.00445 mg.), if applied for a few seconds to the secretion surrounding a gland, causes the inflection of the same tentacle. When a highly sensitive leaf is immersed in a solution, and there is ample time for absorption, the 1/268800 of a grain [page 271] (.00024 mg.) is sufficient to excite a single tentacle into movement. The nitrate of ammonia induces aggregation of the protoplasm much less quickly than the carbonate, but is more potent in causing inflection. A drop containing 1/2400 of a grain (.027 mg.) placed on the disc acts powerfully on all the exterior tentacles, which have not themselves received any of the solution; whereas a drop with 1/2800 of a grain caused only a few of these tentacles to bend, but affected rather more plainly the blade. A minute drop applied as before, and containing 1/28800 of a grain (.0025 mg.), caused the tentacle bearing this gland to bend. By the immersion of whole leaves, it was proved that the absorption by a single gland of 1/691200 of a grain (.0000937 mg.) was sufficient to set the same tentacle into movement. The phosphate of ammonia is much more powerful than the nitrate. A drop containing 1/3840 of a grain (.0169 mg.) placed on the disc of a sensitive leaf causes most of the exterior tentacles to be inflected, as well as the blade of the leaf. A minute drop containing 1/153600 of a grain (.000423 mg.), applied for a few seconds to a gland, acts, as shown by the movement of the tentacle. When a leaf is immersed in thirty minims (1.7748 ml.) of a solution of one part by weight of the salt to 21,875,000 of water, the absorption by a gland of only the 1/19760000 of a grain (.00000328 mg.), that is, about the one-twenty-millionth of a grain, is sufficient to cause the tentacle bearing this gland to bend to the centre of the leaf. In this experiment, owing to the presence of the water of crystallisation, less than the one-thirty-millionth of a grain of the efficient elements could have been absorbed. There is nothing remarkable in such minute quantities being absorbed by the glands, [page 272] for all physiologists admit that the salts of ammonia, which must be brought in still smaller quantity by a single shower of rain to the roots, are absorbed by them. Nor is it surprising that Drosera should be enabled to profit by the absorption of these salts, for yeast and other low fungoid forms flourish in solutions of ammonia, if the other necessary elements are present. But it is an astonishing fact, on which I will not here again enlarge, that so inconceivably minute a quantity as the one-twenty-millionth of a grain of phosphate of ammonia should induce some change in a gland of Drosera, sufficient to cause a motor impulse to be sent down the whole length of the tentacle; this impulse exciting movement often through an angle of above 180o. I know not whether to be most astonished at this fact, or that the pressure of a minute bit of hair, supported by the dense secretion, should quickly cause conspicuous movement. Moreover, this extreme sensitiveness, exceeding that of the most delicate part of the human body, as well as the power of transmitting various impulses from one part of the leaf to another, have been acquired without the intervention of any nervous system. As few plants are at present known to possess glands specially adapted for absorption, it seemed worth while to try the effects on Drosera of various other salts, besides those of ammonia, and of various acids. Their action, as described in the eighth chapter, does not correspond at all strictly with their chemical affinities, as inferred from the classification commonly followed. The nature of the base is far more influential than that of the acid; and this is known to hold good with animals. For instance, nine salts of sodium all caused well-marked inflection, and none of them were poisonous in small doses; whereas seven of the nine corre- [page 273] sponding salts of potassium produced no effect, two causing slight inflection. Small doses, moreover, of some of the latter salts were poisonous. The salts of sodium and potassium, when injected into the veins of animals, likewise differ widely in their action. The so-called earthy salts produce hardly any effect on Drosera. On the other hand, most of the metallic salts cause rapid and strong inflection, and are highly poisonous; but there are some odd exceptions to this rule; thus chloride of lead and zinc, as well as two salts of barium, did not cause inflection, and were not poisonous. Most of the acids which were tried, though much diluted (one part to 437 of water), and given in small doses, acted powerfully on Drosera; nineteen, out of the twenty-four, causing the tentacles to be more or less inflected. Most of them, even the organic acids, are poisonous, often highly so; and this is remarkable, as the juices of so many plants contain acids. Benzoic acid, which is innocuous to animals, seems to be as poisonous to Drosera as hydrocyanic. On the other hand, hydrochloric acid is not poisonous either to animals or to Drosera, and induces only a moderate amount of inflection. Many acids excite the glands to secrete an extraordinary quantity of mucus; and the protoplasm within their cells seems to be often killed, as may be inferred from the surrounding fluid soon becoming pink. It is strange that allied acids act very differently: formic acid induces very slight inflection, and is not poisonous; whereas acetic acid of the same strength acts most powerfully and is poisonous. Lactic acid is also poisonous, but causes inflection only after a considerable lapse of time. Malic acid acts slightly, whereas citric and tartaric acids produce no effect. [page 274] In the ninth chapter the effects of the absorption of various alkaloids and certain other substances were described. Although some of these are poisonous, yet as several, which act powerfully on the nervous system of animals, produce no effect on Drosera, we may infer that the extreme sensibility of the glands, and their power of transmitting an influence to other parts of the leaf, causing movement, or modified secretion, or aggregation, does not depend on the presence of a diffused element, allied to nerve-tissue. One of the most remarkable facts is that long immersion in the poison of the cobra-snake does not in the least check, but rather stimulates, the spontaneous movements of the protoplasm in the cells of the tentacles. Solutions of various salts and acids behave very differently in delaying or in quite arresting the subsequent action of a solution of phosphate of ammonia. Camphor dissolved in water acts as a stimulant, as do small doses of certain essential oils, for they cause rapid and strong inflection. Alcohol is not a stimulant. The vapours of camphor, alcohol, chloroform, sulphuric and nitric ether, are poisonous in moderately large doses, but in small doses serve as narcotics or, anaesthetics, greatly delaying the subsequent action of meat. But some of these vapours also act as stimulants, exciting rapid, almost spasmodic movements in the tentacles. Carbonic acid is likewise a narcotic, and retards the aggregation of the protoplasm when carbonate of ammonia is subsequently given. The first access of air to plants which have been immersed in this gas sometimes acts as a stimulant and induces movement. But, as before remarked, a special pharmacopoeia would be necessary to describe the diversified effects of various substances on the leaves of Drosera. In the tenth chapter it was shown that the sensitive- [page 275] ness of the leaves appears to be wholly confined to the glands and to the immediately underlying cells. It was further shown that the motor impulse and other forces or influences, proceeding from the glands when excited, pass through the cellular tissue, and not along the fibro-vascular bundles. A gland sends its motor impulse with great rapidity down the pedicel of the same tentacle to the basal part which alone bends. The impulse, then passing onwards, spreads on all sides to the surrounding tentacles, first affecting those which stand nearest and then those farther off. But by being thus spread out, and from the cells of the disc not being so much elongated as those of the tentacles, it loses force, and here travels much more slowly than down the pedicels. Owing also to the direction and form of the cells, it passes with greater ease and celerity in a longitudinal than in a transverse line across the disc. The impulse proceeding from the glands of the extreme marginal tentacles does not seem to have force enough to affect the adjoining tentacles; and this may be in part due to their length. The impulse from the glands of the next few inner rows spreads chiefly to the tentacles on each side and towards the centre of the leaf; but that proceeding from the glands of the shorter tentacles on the disc radiates almost equally on all sides. When a gland is strongly excited by the quantity or quality of the substance placed on it, the motor impulse travels farther than from one slightly excited; and if several glands are simultaneously excited, the impulses from all unite and spread still farther. As soon as a gland is excited, it discharges an impulse which extends to a considerable distance; but afterwards, whilst the gland is secreting and absorbing, the impulse suffices only to keep the same tentacle [page 276] inflected; though the inflection may last for many days. If the bending place of a tentacle receives an impulse from its own gland, the movement is always towards the centre of the leaf; and so it is with all the tentacles, when their glands are excited by immersion in a proper fluid. The short ones in the middle part of the disc must be excepted, as these do not bend at all when thus excited. On the other hand, when the motor impulse comes from one side of the disc, the surrounding tentacles, including the short ones in the middle of the disc, all bend with precision towards the point of excitement, wherever this may be seated. This is in every way a remarkable phenomenon; for the leaf falsely appears as if endowed with the senses of an animal. It is all the more remarkable, as when the motor impulse strikes the base of a tentacle obliquely with respect to its flattened surface, the contraction of the cells must be confined to one, two, or a very few rows at one end. And different sides of the surrounding tentacles must be acted on, in order that all should bend with precision to the point of excitement. The motor impulse, as it spreads from one or more glands across the disc, enters the bases of the surrounding tentacles, and immediately acts on the bending place. It does not in the first place proceed up the tentacles to the glands, exciting them to reflect back an impulse to their bases. Nevertheless, some influence is sent up to the glands, as their secretion is soon increased and rendered acid; and then the glands, being thus excited, send back some other influence (not dependent on increased secretion, nor on the inflection of the tentacles), causing the protoplasm to aggregate in cell beneath cell. This may [page 277] be called a reflex action, though probably very different from that proceeding from the nerve-ganglion of an animal; and it is the only known case of reflex action in the vegetable kingdom. About the mechanism of the movements and the nature of the motor impulse we know very little. During the act of inflection fluid certainly travels from one part to another of the tentacles. But the hypothesis which agrees best with the observed facts is that the motor impulse is allied in nature to the aggregating process; and that this causes the molecules of the cell-walls to approach each other, in the same manner as do the molecules of the protoplasm within the cells; so that the cell-walls contract. But some strong objections may be urged against this view. The re-expansion of the tentacles is largely due to the elasticity of their outer cells, which comes into play as soon as those on the inner side cease contracting with prepotent force; but we have reason to suspect that fluid is continually and slowly attracted into the outer cells during the act of re-expansion, thus increasing their tension. I have now given a brief recapitulation of the chief points observed by me, with respect to the structure, movements, constitution, and habits of Drosera rotundifolia; and we see how little has been made out in comparison with what remains unexplained and unknown.

              " 'XII. ON THE STRUCTURE AND MOVEMENTS OF SOME OTHER SPECIES OF DROSERA. Drosera anglica—Drosera intermedia—Drosera capensis—Drosera spathulata—Drosera filiformis—Drosera binata—Concluding remarks. I examined six other species of Drosera, some of them inhabitants of distant countries, chiefly for the sake of ascertaining whether they caught insects. This seemed the more necessary as the leaves of some of the species differ to an extraordinary degree in shape from the rounded ones of Drosera rotundifolia. In functional powers, however, they differ very little. [Drosera anglica (Hudson).*—The leaves of this species, which was sent to me from Ireland, are much elongated, and gradually widen from the footstalk to the bluntly pointed apex. They stand almost erect, and their blades sometimes exceed 1 inch in length, whilst their breadth is only the 1/5 of an inch. The glands of all the tentacles have the same structure, so that the extreme marginal ones do not differ from the others, as in the case of Drosera rotundifolia. When they are irritated by being roughly touched, or by the pressure of minute inorganic particles, or by contact with animal matter, or by the absorption of carbonate of ammonia, the tentacles become inflected; the basal portion being the chief seat of movement. Cutting or pricking the blade of the leaf did not excite any movement. They frequently capture insects, and the glands of the inflected tentacles pour forth much acid secretion. Bits of roast meat were placed on some glands, and the tentacles began to move in 1 m. or * Mrs. Treat has given an excellent account in ‘The American Naturalist,’ December 1873, p. 705, of Drosera longifolia (which is a synonym in part of Drosera anglica), of Drosera rotundifolia and filiformis. [page 279] 1 m. 30 s.; and in 1 hr. 10 m. reached the centre. Two bits of boiled cork, one of boiled thread, and two of coal-cinders taken from the fire, were placed, by the aid of an instrument which had been immersed in boiling water, on five glands; these superfluous precautions having been taken on account of M. Ziegler’s statements. One of the particles of cinder caused some inflection in 8 hrs. 45 m., as did after 23 hrs. the other particle of cinder, the bit of thread, and both bits of cork. Three glands were touched half a dozen times with a needle; one of the tentacles became well inflected in 17 m., and re-expanded after 24 hrs.; the two others never moved. The homogeneous fluid within the cells of the tentacles undergoes aggregation after these have become inflected; especially if given a solution of carbonate of ammonia; and I observed the usual movements in the masses of protoplasm. In one case, aggregation ensued in 1 hr. 10 m. after a tentacle had carried a bit of meat to the centre. From these facts it is clear that the tentacles of Drosera anglica behave like those of Drosera rotundifolia. If an insect is placed on the central glands, or has been naturally caught there, the apex of the leaf curls inwards. For instance, dead flies were placed on three leaves near their bases, and after 24 hrs. the previously straight apices were curled completely over, so as to embrace and conceal the flies; they had therefore moved through an angle of 180o. After three days the apex of one leaf, together with the tentacles, began to re-expand. But as far as I have seen— and I made many trials—the sides of the leaf are never inflected, and this is the one functional difference between this species and Drosera rotundifolia. Drosera intermedia (Hayne).—This species is quite as common in some parts of England as Drosera rotundifolia. It differs from Drosera anglica, as far as the leaves are concerned, only in their smaller size, and in their tips being generally a little reflexed. They capture a large number of insects. The tentacles are excited into movement by all the causes above specified; and aggregation ensues, with movement of the protoplasmic masses. I have seen, through a lens, a tentacle beginning to bend in less than a minute after a particle of raw meat had been placed on the gland. The apex of the leaf curls over an exciting object as in the case of Drosera anglica. Acid secretion is copiously poured over captured insects. A leaf which had embraced a fly with all its tentacles re-expanded after nearly three days. Drosera capensis.—This species, a native of the Cape of Good Hope, was sent to me by Dr. Hooker. The leaves are elongated, slightly concave along the middle and taper towards the apex, [page 280] which is bluntly pointed and reflexed. They rise from an almost woody axis, and their greatest peculiarity consists in their foliaceous green footstalks, which are almost as broad and even longer than the gland-bearing blade. This species, therefore, probably draws more nourishment from the air, and less from captured insects, than the other species of the genus. Nevertheless, the tentacles are crowded together on the disc, and are extremely numerous; those on the margins being much longer than the central ones. All the glands have the same form; their secretion is extremely viscid and acid. The specimen which I examined had only just recovered from a weak state of health. This may account for the tentacles moving very slowly when particles of meat were placed on the glands, and perhaps for my never succeeding in causing any movement by repeatedly touching them with a needle. But with all the species of the genus this latter stimulus is the least effective of any. Particles of glass, cork, and coal-cinders, were placed on the glands of six tentacles; and one alone moved after an interval of 2 hrs. 30 m. Nevertheless, two glands were extremely sensitive to very small doses of the nitrate of ammonia, namely to about 1/20 of a minim of a solution (one part to 5250 of water), containing only 1/115200 of a grain (.000562 mg.) of the salt. Fragments of flies were placed on two leaves near their tips, which became incurved in 15 hrs. A fly was also placed in the middle of the leaf; in a few hours the tentacles on each side embraced it, and in 8 hrs. the whole leaf directly beneath the fly was a little bent transversely. By the next morning, after 23 hrs., the leaf was curled so completely over that the apex rested on the upper end of the footstalk. In no case did the sides of the leaves become inflected. A crushed fly was placed on the foliaceous footstalk, but produced no effect. Drosera spathulata (sent to me by Dr. Hooker).—I made only a few observations on this Australian species, which has long, narrow leaves, gradually widening towards their tips. The glands of the extreme marginal tentacles are elongated and differ from the others, as in the case of Drosera rotundifolia. A fly was placed on a leaf, and in 18 hrs. it was embraced by the adjoining tentacles. Gum-water dropped on several leaves produced no effect. A fragment of a leaf was immersed in a few drops of a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 146 of water; all the glands were instantly blackened; the process of aggregation could be seen travelling rapidly down the cells of the tentacles; and the granules of protoplasm soon united into spheres and variously shaped masses, which displayed the usual move- [page 281] ments. Half a minim of a solution of one part of nitrate of ammonia to 146 of water was next placed on the centre of a leaf; after 6 hrs. some marginal tentacles on both sides were inflected, and after 9 hrs. they met in the centre. The lateral edges of the leaf also became incurved, so that it formed a half-cylinder; but the apex of the leaf in none of my few trials was inflected. The above dose of the nitrate (viz. 1/320 of a grain, or .202 mg.) was too powerful, for in the course of 23 hrs. the leaf died. Drosera filiformis.—This North American species grows in such abundance in parts of New Jersey as almost to cover the ground. It catches, according to Mrs. Treat,* an extraordinary number of small and large insects, even great flies of the genus Asilus, moths, and butterflies. The specimen which I examined, sent me by Dr. Hooker, had thread-like leaves, from 6 to 12 inches in length, with the upper surface convex and the lower flat and slightly channelled. The whole convex surface, down to the roots—for there is no distinct footstalk—is covered with short gland-bearing tentacles, those on the margins being the longest and reflexed. Bits of meat placed on the glands of some tentacles caused them to be slightly inflected in 20 m.; but the plant was not in a vigorous state. After 6 hrs. they moved through an angle of 90o, and in 24 hrs. reached the centre. The surrounding tentacles by this time began to curve inwards. Ultimately a large drop of extremely viscid, slightly acid secretion was poured over the meat from the united glands. Several other glands were touched with a little saliva, and the tentacles became incurved in under 1 hr., and re-expanded after 18 hrs. Particles of glass, cork, cinders, thread, and gold-leaf, were placed on numerous glands on two leaves; in about 1 hr. four tentacles became curved, and four others after an additional interval of 2 hrs. 30 m. I never once succeeded in causing any movement by repeatedly touching the glands with a needle; and Mrs. Treat made similar trials for me with no success. Small flies were placed on several leaves near their tips, but the thread-like blade became only on one occasion very slightly bent, directly beneath the insect. Perhaps this indicates that the blades of vigorous plants would bend over captured insects, and Dr. Canby informs me that this is the case; but the movement cannot be strongly pronounced, as it was not observed by Mrs. Treat. Drosera binata (or dichotoma).—I am much indebted to Lady * ‘American Naturalist,’ December 1873, page 705. [page 282] Dorothy Nevill for a fine plant of this almost gigantic Australian species, which differs in some interesting points from those previously described. In this specimen the rush-like footstalks of the leaves were 20 inches in length. The blade bifurcates at its junction with the footstalk, and twice or thrice afterwards, curling about in an irregular manner. It is narrow, being only 3/20 of an inch in breadth. One blade was 7 1/2 inches long, so that the entire leaf, including the footstalk, was above 27 inches in length. Both surfaces are slightly hollowed out. The upper surface is covered with tentacles arranged in alternate rows; those in the middle being short and crowded together, those towards the margins longer, even twice or thrice as long as the blade is broad. The glands of the exterior tentacles are of a much darker red than those of the central ones. The pedicels of all are green. The apex of the blade is attenuated, and bears very long tentacles. Mr. Copland informs me that the leaves of a plant which he kept for some years were generally covered with captured insects before they withered. The leaves do not differ in essential points of structure or of function from those of the previously described species. Bits of meat or a little saliva placed on the glands of the exterior tentacles caused well-marked movement in 3 m., and particles of glass acted in 4 m. The tentacles with the latter particles re-expanded after 22 hrs. A piece of leaf immersed in a few drops of a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 437 of water had all the glands blackened and all the tentacles inflected in 5 m. A bit of raw meat, placed on several glands in the medial furrow, was well clasped in 2 hrs. 10 m. by the marginal tentacles on both sides. Bits of roast meat and small flies did not act quite so quickly; and albumen and fibrin still less quickly. One of the bits of meat excited so much secretion (which is always acid) that it flowed some way down the medial furrow, causing the inflection of the tentacles on both sides as far as it extended. Particles of glass placed on the glands in the medial furrow did not stimulate them sufficiently for any motor impulse to be sent to the outer tentacles. In no case was the blade of the leaf, even the attenuated apex, at all inflected. On both the upper and lower surface of the blade there are numerous minute, almost sessile glands, consisting of four, eight, or twelve cells. On the lower surface they are pale purple, on the upper greenish. Nearly similar organs occur on the foot-stalks, but they are smaller and often in a shrivelled condition. The minute glands on the blade can absorb rapidly: thus, a piece of leaf was immersed in a solution of one part of carbonate [page 283] of ammonia to 218 of water (1 gr. to 2 oz.), and in 5 m. they were all so much darkened as to be almost black, with their contents aggregated. They do not, as far as I could observe, secrete spontaneously; but in between 2 and 3 hrs. after a leaf had been rubbed with a bit of raw meat moistened with saliva, they seemed to be secreting freely; and this conclusion was afterwards supported by other appearances. They are, therefore, homologous with the sessile glands hereafter to be described on the leaves of Dionaea and Drosophyllum. In this latter genus they are associated, as in the present case, with glands which secrete spontaneously, that is, without being excited. Drosera binata presents another and more remarkable peculiarity, namely, the presence of a few tentacles on the backs of the leaves, near their margins. These are perfect in structure; spiral vessels run up their pedicels; their glands are surrounded by drops of viscid secretion, and they have the power of absorbing. This latter fact was shown by the glands immediately becoming black, and the protoplasm aggregated, when a leaf was placed in a little solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 437 of water. These dorsal tentacles are short, not being nearly so long as the marginal ones on the upper surface; some of them are so short as almost to graduate into the minute sessile glands. Their presence, number, and size, vary on different leaves, and they are arranged rather irregularly. On the back of one leaf I counted as many as twenty-one along one side. These dorsal tentacles differ in one important respect from those on the upper surface, namely, in not possessing any power of movement, in whatever manner they may be stimulated. Thus, portions of four leaves were placed at different times in solutions of carbonate of ammonia (one part to 437 or 218 of water), and all the tentacles on the upper surface soon became closely inflected; but the dorsal ones did not move, though the leaves were left in the solution for many hours, and though their glands from their blackened colour had obviously absorbed some of the salt. Rather young leaves should be selected for such trials, for the dorsal tentacles, as they grow old and begin to wither, often spontaneously incline towards the middle of the leaf. If these tentacles had possessed the power of movement, they would not have been thus rendered more serviceable to the plant; for they are not long enough to bend round the margin of the leaf so as to reach an insect caught on the upper surface, Nor would it have been of any use if these tentacles could have [page 284] moved towards the middle of the lower surface, for there are no viscid glands there by which insects can be caught. Although they have no power of movement, they are probably of some use by absorbing animal matter from any minute insect which may be caught by them, and by absorbing ammonia from the rain-water. But their varying presence and size, and their irregular position, indicate that they are not of much service, and that they are tending towards abortion. In a future chapter we shall see that Drosophyllum, with its elongated leaves, probably represents the condition of an early progenitor of the genus Drosera; and none of the tentacles of Drosophyllum, neither those on the upper nor lower surface of the leaves, are capable of movement when excited, though they capture numerous insects, which serve as nutriment. Therefore it seems that Drosera binata has retained remnants of certain ancestral characters—namely a few motionless tentacles on the backs of the leaves, and fairly well developed sessile glands—which have been lost by most or all of the other species of the genus.] Concluding Remarks.—From what we have now seen, there can be little doubt that most or probably all the species of Drosera are adapted for catching insects by nearly the same means. Besides the two Australian species above described, it is said* that two other species from this country, namely Drosera pallida and Drosera sulphurea, “close their leaves upon insects with great rapidity: and the same phenomenon is manifested by an Indian species, D. lunata, and by several of those of the Cape of Good Hope, especially by D. trinervis.” Another Australian species, Drosera heterophylla (made by Lindley into a distinct genus, Sondera) is remarkable from its peculiarly shaped leaves, but I know nothing of its power of catching insects, for I have seen only dried specimens. The leaves form minute flattened cups, with the footstalks attached not to one margin, but to the bottom. The * ‘Gardener’s Chronicle,’ 1874, p. 209. [page 285] inner surface and the edges of the cups are studded with tentacles, which include fibro-vascular bundles, rather different from those seen by me in any other species; for some of the vessels are barred and punctured, instead of being spiral. The glands secrete copiously, judging from the quantity of dried secretion adhering to them. [page 286] ',\n",

This plant, commonly called Venus’ fly-trap, from the rapidity and force of its movements, is one of the most wonderful in the world.* It is a member of the small family of the Droseraceae, and is found only in the eastern part of North Carolina, growing in damp situations. The roots are small; those of a moderately fine plant which I examined consisted of two branches about 1 inch in length, springing from a bulbous enlargement. They probably serve, as in the case of Drosera, solely for the absorption of water; for a gardener, who has been very successful in the cultivation of this plant, grows it, like an epiphytic orchid, in well-drained damp moss without any soil.** The form of the bilobed leaf, with its foliaceous footstalk, is shown in the accompanying drawing (fig. 12). * Dr. Hooker, in his address to the British Association at Belfast, 1874, has given so full an historical account of the observations which have been published on the habits of this plant, that it would be superfluous on my part to repeat them. ** ‘Gardener’s Chronicle,’ 1874, p. 464. [page 287] The two lobes stand at rather less than a right angle to each other. Three minute pointed processes or filaments, placed triangularly, project from the upper surfaces of both; but I have seen two leaves with four filaments on each side, and another with only two. These filaments are remarkable from their extreme sensitiveness to a touch, as shown not by their own movement, but by that of the lobes. The margins of the leaf are prolonged into sharp rigid projections which I will call spikes, into each of which a bundle FIG. 12. (Dionaea muscipula.) Leaf viewed laterally in its expanded state. of spiral vessels enters. The spikes stand in such a position that, when the lobes close, they inter-lock like the teeth of a rat-trap. The midrib of the leaf, on the lower side, is strongly developed and prominent. The upper surface of the leaf is thickly covered, excepting towards the margins, with minute glands of a reddish or purplish colour, the rest of the leaf being green. There are no glands on the spikes, or on the foliaceous footstalk, The glands are formed of from [page 288] twenty to thirty polygonal cells, filled with purple fluid. Their upper surface is convex. They stand on very short pedicels, into which spiral vessels do not enter, in which respect they differ from the tentacles of Drosera. They secrete, but only when excited by the absorption of certain matters; and they have the power of absorption. Minute projections, formed of eight divergent arms of a reddish-brown or orange colour, and appearing under the microscope like elegant little flowers, are scattered in considerable numbers over the foot-stalk, the backs of the leaves, and the spikes, with a few on the upper surface of the lobes. These octofid projections are no doubt homologous with the papillae on the leaves of Drosera rotundifolia. There are also a few very minute, simple, pointed hairs, about 7/12000 (.0148 mm.) of an inch in length on the backs of the leaves. The sensitive filaments are formed of several rows of elongated cells, filled with purplish fluid. They are a little above the 1/20 of an inch in length; are thin and delicate, and taper to a point. I examined the bases of several, making sections of them, but no trace of the entrance of any vessel could be seen. The apex is sometimes bifid or even trifid, owing to a slight separation between the terminal pointed cells. Towards the base there is constriction, formed of broader cells, beneath which there is an articulation, supported on an enlarged base, consisting of differently shaped polygonal cells. As the filaments project at right angles to the surface of the leaf, they would have been liable to be broken whenever the lobes closed together, had it not been for the articulation which allows them to bend flat down. These filaments, from their tips to their bases, are exquisitely sensitive to a momentary touch. It is scarcely [page 289] possible to touch them ever so lightly or quickly with any hard object without causing the lobes to close. A piece of very delicate human hair, 2 1/2 inches in length, held dangling over a filament, and swayed to and fro so as to touch it, did not excite any movement. But when a rather thick cotton thread of the same length was similarly swayed, the lobes closed. Pinches of fine wheaten flour, dropped from a height, produced no effect. The above-mentioned hair was then fixed into a handle, and cut off so that 1 inch projected; this length being sufficiently rigid to support itself in a nearly horizontal line. The extremity was then brought by a slow movement laterally into contact with the tip of a filament, and the leaf instantly closed. On another occasion two or three touches of the same kind were necessary before any movement ensued. When we consider how flexible a fine hair is, we may form some idea how slight must be the touch given by the extremity of a piece, 1 inch in length, moved slowly. Although these filaments are so sensitive to a momentary and delicate touch, they are far less sensitive than the glands of Drosera to prolonged pressure. Several times I succeeded in placing on the tip of a filament, by the aid of a needle moved with extreme slowness, bits of rather thick human hair, and these did not excite movement, although they were more than ten times as long as those which caused the tentacles of Drosera to bend; and although in this latter case they were largely supported by the dense secretion. On the other hand, the glands of Drosera may be struck with a needle or any hard object, once, twice, or even thrice, with considerable force, and no movement ensues. This singular difference in the nature of the sensitiveness of the filaments of Dionaea and of [page 290] the glands of Drosera evidently stands in relation to the habits of the two plants. If a minute insect alights with its delicate feet on the glands of Drosera, it is caught by the viscid secretion, and the slight, though prolonged pressure, gives notice of the presence of prey, which is secured by the slow bending of the tentacles. On the other hand, the sensitive filaments of Dionaea are not viscid, and the capture of insects can be assured only by their sensitiveness to a momentary touch, followed by the rapid closure of the lobes. As just stated, the filaments are not glandular, and do not secrete. Nor have they the power of absorption, as may be inferred from drops of a solution of carbonate of ammonia (one part to 146 of water), placed on two filaments, not producing any effect on the contents of their cells, nor causing the lobes to close, When, however, a small portion of a leaf with an attached filament was cut off and immersed in the same solution, the fluid within the basal cells became almost instantly aggregated into purplish or colourless, irregularly shaped masses of matter. The process of aggregation gradually travelled up the filaments from cell to cell to their extremities, that is in a reverse course to what occurs in the tentacles of Drosera when their glands have been excited. Several other filaments were cut off close to their bases, and left for 1 hr. 30 m. in a weaker solution of one part of the carbonate to 218 of water, and this caused aggregation in all the cells, commencing as before at the bases of the filaments. Long immersion of the filaments in distilled water likewise causes aggregation. Nor is it rare to find the contents of a few of the terminal cells in a spontaneously aggregated condition. The aggregated [page 291] masses undergo incessant slow changes of form, uniting and again separating; and some of them apparently revolve round their own axes. A current of colourless granular protoplasm could also be seen travelling round the walls of the cells. This current ceases to be visible as soon as the contents are well aggregated; but it probably still continues, though no longer visible, owing to all the granules in the flowing layer having become united with the central masses. In all these respects the filaments of Dionaea behave exactly like the tentacles of Drosera. Notwithstanding this similarity there is one remarkable difference. The tentacles of Drosera, after their glands have been repeatedly touched, or a particle of any kind has been placed on them, become inflected and strongly aggregated. No such effect is produced by touching the filaments of Dionaea; I compared, after an hour or two, some which had been touched and some which had not, and others after twenty-five hours, and there was no difference in the contents of the cells. The leaves were kept open all the time by clips; so that the filaments were not pressed against the opposite lobe. Drops of water, or a thin broken stream, falling from a height on the filaments, did not cause the blades to close; though these filaments were afterwards proved to be highly sensitive. No doubt, as in the case of Drosera, the plant is indifferent to the heaviest shower of rain. Drops of a solution of a half an ounce of sugar to a fluid ounce of water were repeatedly allowed to fall from a height on the filaments, but produced no effect, unless they adhered to them. Again, I blew many times through a fine pointed tube with my utmost force against the filaments without any effect; such blowing being received [page 292] with as much indifference as no doubt is a heavy gale of wind. We thus see that the sensitiveness of the filaments is of a specialised nature, being related to a momentary touch rather than to prolonged pressure; and the touch must not be from fluids, such as air or water, but from some solid object. Although drops of water and of a moderately strong solution of sugar, falling on the filaments, does not excite them, yet the immersion of a leaf in pure water sometimes caused the lobes to close. One leaf was left immersed for 1 hr. 10 m., and three other leaves for some minutes, in water at temperatures varying between 59° and 65° (15° to 18°.3 Cent.) without any effect. One, however, of these four leaves, on being gently withdrawn from the water, closed rather quickly. The three other leaves were proved to be in good condition, as they closed when their filaments were touched. Nevertheless two fresh leaves on being dipped into water at 75° and 62 1/2° (23°.8 and 16°.9 Cent.) instantly closed. These were then placed with their footstalks in water, and after 23 hrs. partially re-expanded; on touching their filaments one of them closed. This latter leaf after an additional 24 hrs. again re-expanded, and now, on the filaments of both leaves being touched, both closed. We thus see that a short immersion in water does not at all injure the leaves, but sometimes excites the lobes to close. The movement in the above cases was evidently not caused by the temperature of the water. It has been shown that long immersion causes the purple fluid within the cells of the sensitive filaments to become aggregated; and the tentacles of Drosera are acted on in the same manner by long immersion, often being somewhat inflected. In both cases the result is probably due to a slight degree of exosmose. [page 293] I am confirmed in this belief by the effects of immersing a leaf of Dionaea in a moderately strong solution of sugar; the leaf having been previously left for 1 hr. 10 m. in water without any effect; for now the lobes closed rather quickly, the tips of the marginal spikes crossing in 2 m. 30 s., and the leaf being completely shut in 3 m. Three leaves were then immersed in a solution of half an ounce of sugar to a fluid ounce of water, and all three leaves closed quickly. As I was doubtful whether this was due to the cells on the upper surface of the lobes, or to the sensitive filaments, being acted on by exosmose, one leaf was first tried by pouring a little of the same solution in the furrow between the lobes over the midrib, which is the chief seat of movement. It was left there for some time, but no movement ensued. The whole upper surface of leaf was then painted (except close round the bases of the sensitive filaments, which I could not do without risk of touching them) with the same solution, but no effect was produced. So that the cells on the upper surface are not thus affected. But when, after many trials, I succeeded in getting a drop of the solution to cling to one of the filaments, the leaf quickly closed. Hence we may, I think, conclude that the solution causes fluid to pass out of the delicate cells of the filaments by exosmose; and that this sets up some molecular change in their contents, analogous to that which must be produced by a touch. The immersion of leaves in a solution of sugar affects them for a much longer time than does an immersion in water, or a touch on the filaments; for in these latter cases the lobes begin to re-expand in less than a day. On the other hand, of the three leaves which were immersed for a short time in the solution, and were then washed by means of a syringe inserted [page 294] between the lobes, one re-expanded after two days; a second after seven days; and the third after nine days. The leaf which closed, owing to a drop of the solution having adhered to one of the filaments, opened after two days. I was surprised to find on two occasions that the heat from the rays of the sun, concentrated by a lens on the bases of several filaments, so that they were scorched and discoloured, did not cause any movement; though the leaves were active, as they closed, though rather slowly, when a filament on the opposite side was touched. On a third trial, a fresh leaf closed after a time, though very slowly; the rate not being increased by one of the filaments, which had not been injured, being touched. After a day these three leaves opened, and were fairly sensitive when the uninjured filaments were touched. The sudden immersion of a leaf into boiling water does not cause it to close. Judging from the analogy of Drosera, the heat in these several cases was too great and too suddenly applied. The surface of the blade is very slightly sensitive; It may be freely and roughly handled, without any movement being caused. A leaf was scratched rather hard with a needle, but did not close; but when the triangular space between the three filaments on another leaf was similarly scratched, the lobes closed. They always closed when the blade or midrib was deeply pricked or cut. Inorganic bodies, even of large size, such as bits of stone, glass, &c.—or organic bodies not containing soluble nitrogenous matter, such as bits of wood, cork, moss,—or bodies containing soluble nitrogenous matter, if perfectly dry, such as bits of meat, albumen, gelatine, &c., may be long left (and many were tried) on the lobes, and no movement is excited. The result, however, is widely different, as we [page 295] shall presently see, if nitrogenous organic bodies which are at all damp, are left on the lobes; for these then close by a slow and gradual movement, very different from that caused by touching one of the sensitive filaments. The footstalk is not in the least sensitive; a pin may be driven through it, or it may be cut off, and no movement follows. The upper surface of the lobes, as already stated, is thickly covered with small purplish, almost sessile glands. These have the power both of secretion and absorption; but unlike those of Drosera, they do not secrete until excited by the absorption of nitrogenous matter. No other excitement, as far as I have seen, produces this effect. Objects, such as bits of wood, cork, moss, paper, stone, or glass, may be left for a length of time on the surface of a leaf, and it remains quite dry. Nor does it make any difference if the lobes close over such objects. For instance, some little balls of blotting paper were placed on a leaf, and a filament was touched; and when after 24 hrs. the lobes began to re-open, the balls were removed by the aid of thin pincers, and were found perfectly dry. On the other hand, if a bit of damp meat or a crushed fly is placed on the surface of an expanded leaf, the glands after a time secrete freely. In one such case there was a little secretion directly beneath the meat in 4 hrs.; and after an additional 3 hrs. there was a considerable quantity both under and close round it. In another case, after 3 hrs. 40 m., the bit of meat was quite wet. But none of the glands secreted, excepting those which actually touched the meat or the secretion containing dissolved animal matter. If, however, the lobes are made to close over a bit of meat or an insect, the result is different, for the glands over the whole surface of the leaf now secrete copiously. [page 296] As in this case the glands on both sides are pressed against the meat or insect, the secretion from the first is twice as great as when a bit of meat is laid on the surface of one lobe; and as the two lobes come into almost close contact, the secretion, containing dissolved animal matter, spreads by capillary attraction, causing fresh glands on both sides to begin secreting in a continually widening circle. The secretion is almost colourless, slightly mucilaginous, and, judging by the manner in which it coloured litmus paper, more strongly acid than that of Drosera. It is so copious that on one occasion, when a leaf was cut open, on which a small cube of albumen had been placed 45 hrs. before, drops rolled off the leaf. On another occasion, in which a leaf with an enclosed bit of roast meat spontaneously opened after eight days, there was so much secretion in the furrow over the midrib that it trickled down. A large crushed fly (Tipula) was placed on a leaf from which a small portion at the base of one lobe had previously been cut away, so that an opening was left; and through this, the secretion continued to run down the footstalk during nine days,—that is, for as long a time as it was observed. By forcing up one of the lobes, I was able to see some distance between them, and all the glands within sight were secreting freely. We have seen that inorganic and non-nitrogenous objects placed on the leaves do not excite any movement; but nitrogenous bodies, if in the least degree damp, cause after several hours the lobes to close slowly. Thus bits of quite dry meat and gelatine were placed at opposite ends of the same leaf, and in the course of 24 hrs. excited neither secretion nor movement. They were then dipped in water, their surfaces dried on blotting paper, and replaced on the same [page 297] leaf, the plant being now covered with a bell-glass. After 24 hrs. the damp meat had excited some acid secretion, and the lobes at this end of the leaf were almost shut. At the other end, where the damp gelatine lay, the leaf was still quite open, nor had any secretion been excited; so that, as with Drosera, gelatine is not nearly so exciting a substance as meat. The secretion beneath the meat was tested by pushing a strip of litmus paper under it (the filaments not being touched), and this slight stimulus caused the leaf to shut. On the eleventh day it reopened; but the end where the gelatine lay, expanded several hours before the opposite end with the meat. A second bit of roast meat, which appeared dry, though it had not been purposely dried, was left for 24 hrs. on a leaf, caused neither movement nor secretion. The plant in its pot was now covered with a bell-glass, and the meat absorbed some moisture from the air; this sufficed to excite acid secretion, and by the next morning the leaf was closely shut. A third bit of meat, dried so as to be quite brittle, was placed on a leaf under a bell-glass, and this also became in 24 hrs. slightly damp, and excited some acid secretion, but no movement. A rather large piece of perfectly dry albumen was left at one end of a leaf for 24 hrs. without any effect. It was then soaked for a few minutes in water, rolled about on blotting paper, and replaced on the leaf; in 9 hrs. some slightly acid secretion was excited, and in 24 hrs. this end of the leaf was partially closed. The bit of albumen, which was now surrounded by much secretion, was gently removed, and although no filament was touched, the lobes closed. In this and the previous case, it appears that the absorption of animal matter by the glands renders [page 298] the surface of the leaf much more sensitive to a touch than it is in its ordinary state; and this is a curious fact. Two days afterwards the end of the leaf where nothing had been placed began to open, and on the third day was much more open than the opposite end where the albumen had lain. Lastly, large drops of a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 146 of water were placed on some leaves, but no immediate movement ensued. I did not then know of the slow movement caused by animal matter, otherwise I should have observed the leaves for a longer time, and they would probably have been found closed, though the solution (judging from Drosera) was, perhaps, too strong. From the foregoing cases it is certain that bits of meat and albumen, if at all damp, excite not only the glands to secrete, but the lobes to close. This movement is widely different from the rapid closure caused by one of the filaments being touched. We shall see its importance when we treat of the manner in which insects are captured. There is a great contrast between Drosera and Dionaea in the effects produced by mechanical irritation on the one hand, and the absorption of animal matter on the other. Particles of glass placed on the glands of the exterior tentacles of Drosera excite movement within nearly the same time, as do particles of meat, the latter being rather the most efficient; but when the glands of the disc have bits of meat given them, they transmit a motor impulse to the exterior tentacles much more quickly than do these glands when bearing inorganic particles, or when irritated by repeated touches. On the other hand, with Dionaea, touching the filaments excites incomparably quicker movement than the absorption of animal matter by the glands. Nevertheless, in [page 299] certain cases, this latter stimulus is the more powerful of the two. On three occasions leaves were found which from some cause were torpid, so that their lobes closed only slightly, however much their filaments were irritated; but on inserting crushed insects between the lobes, they became in a day closely shut. The facts just given plainly show that the glands have the power of absorption, for otherwise it is impossible that the leaves should be so differently affected by non-nitrogenous and nitrogenous bodies, and between these latter in a dry and damp condition. It is surprising how slightly damp a bit of meat or albumen need be in order to excite secretion and afterwards slow movement, and equally surprising how minute a quantity of animal matter, when absorbed, suffices to produce these two effects. It seems hardly credible, and yet it is certainly a fact, that a bit of hard-boiled white of egg, first thoroughly dried, then soaked for some minutes in water and rolled on blotting paper, should yield in a few hours enough animal matter to the glands to cause them to secrete, and afterwards the lobes to close. That the glands have the power of absorption is likewise shown by the very different lengths of time (as we shall presently see) during which the lobes remain closed over insects and other bodies yielding soluble nitrogenous matter, and over such as do not yield any. But there is direct evidence of absorption in the condition of the glands which have remained for some time in contact with animal matter. Thus bits of meat and crushed insects were several times placed on glands, and these were compared after some hours with other glands from distant parts of the same leaf. The latter showed not a trace of aggregation, whereas those which had been in contact with the animal matter were [page 300] well aggregated. Aggregation may be seen to occur very quickly if a piece of a leaf is immersed in a weak solution of carbonate of ammonia. Again, small cubes of albumen and gelatine were left for eight days on a leaf, which was then cut open. The whole surface was bathed with acid secretion, and every cell in the many glands which were examined had its contents aggregated in a beautiful manner into dark or pale purple, or colourless globular masses of protoplasm. These underwent incessant slow changes of forms; sometimes separating from one another and then reuniting, exactly as in the cells of Drosera. Boiling water makes the contents of the gland-cells white and opaque, but not so purely white and porcelain-like as in the case of Drosera. How living insects, when naturally caught, excite the glands to secrete so quickly as they do, I know not; but I suppose that the great pressure to which they are subjected forces a little excretion from either extremity of their bodies, and we have seen that an extremely small amount of nitrogenous matter is sufficient to excite the glands. Before passing on to the subject of digestion, I may state that I endeavoured to discover, with no success, the functions of the minute octofid processes with which the leaves are studded. From facts hereafter to be given in the chapters on Aldrovanda and Utricularia, it seemed probable that they served to absorb decayed matter left by the captured insects; but their position on the backs of the leaves and on the footstalks rendered this almost impossible. Nevertheless, leaves were immersed in a solution of one part of urea to 437 of water, and after 24 hrs. the orange layer of protoplasm within the arms of these processes did not appear more aggregated than in other speci- [page 301] mens kept in water, I then tried suspending a leaf in a bottle over an excessively putrid infusion of raw meat, to see whether they absorbed the vapour, but their contents were not affected. Digestive Power of the Secretion.*—When a leaf closes over any object, it may be said to form itself into a temporary stomach; and if the object yields ever so little animal matter, this serves, to use Schiff’s expression, as a peptogene, and the glands on the surface pour forth their acid secretion, which acts like the gastric juice of animals. As so many experiments were tried on the digestive power of Drosera, only a few were made with Dionaea, but they were amply sufficient to prove that it digests, This plant, moreover, is not so well fitted as Drosera for observation, as the process goes on within the closed lobes. Insects, even beetles, after being subjected to the secretion for several days, are surprisingly softened, though their chitinous coats are not corroded, [Experiment 1.—A cube of albumen of 1/10 of an inch (2.540 mm.) was placed at one end of a leaf, and at the other end an oblong piece of gelatine, 1/5 of an inch (5.08 mm.) long, and * Dr. W.M. Canby, of Wilmington, to whom I am much indebted for information regarding Dionaea in its native home, has published in the ‘Gardener’s Monthly,’ Philadelphia, August 1868, some interesting observations. He ascertained that the secretion digests animal matter, such as the contents of insects, bits of meat, &c.; and that the secretion is reabsorbed. He was also well aware that the lobes remain closed for a much longer time when in contact with animal matter than when made to shut by a mere touch, or over objects not yielding soluble nutriment; and that in these latter cases the glands do not secrete. The Rev. Dr. Curtis first observed (‘Boston Journal Nat. Hist.’ vol. i., p. 123) the secretion from the glands. I may here add that a gardener, Mr. Knight, is said (Kirby and Spencer’s ‘Introduction to Entomology,’ 1818, vol. i., p. 295) to have found that a plant of the Dionaea, on the leaves of which “he laid fine filaments of raw beef, was much more luxuriant in its growth than others not so treated.” [page 302] 1/10 broad; the leaf was then made to close. It was cut open after 45 hrs. The albumen was hard and compressed, with its angles only a little rounded; the gelatine was corroded into an oval form; and both were bathed in so much acid secretion that it dropped off the leaf. The digestive process apparently is rather slower than in Drosera, and this agrees with the length of time during which the leaves remain closed over digestible objects. Experiment 2.—A bit of albumen 1/10 of an inch square, but only 1/20 in thickness, and a piece of gelatine of the same size as before, were placed on a leaf, which eight days afterwards was cut open. The surface was bathed with slightly adhesive, very acid secretion, and the glands were all in an aggregated condition. Not a vestige of the albumen or gelatine was left. Similarly sized pieces were placed at the same time on wet moss on the same pot, so that they were subjected to nearly similar conditions; after eight days these were brown, decayed, and matted with fibres of mould, but had not disappeared. Experiment 3.—A piece of albumen 3/20 of an inch (3.81 mm.) long, and 1/20 broad and thick, and a piece of gelatine of the same size as before, were placed on another leaf, which was cut open after seven days; not a vestige of either substance was left, and only a moderate amount of secretion on the surface. Experiment 4.—Pieces of albumen and gelatine, of the same size as in the last experiment, were placed on a leaf, which spontaneously opened after twelve days, and here again not a vestige of either was left, and only a little secretion at one end of the midrib. Experiment 5.—Pieces of albumen and gelatine of the same size were placed on another leaf, which after twelve days was still firmly closed, but had begun to wither; it was cut open, and contained nothing except a vestige of brown matter where the albumen had lain. Experiment 6.—A cube of albumen of 1/10 of an inch and a piece of gelatine of the same size as before were placed on a leaf, which opened spontaneously after thirteen days, The albumen, which was twice as thick as in the latter experiments, was too large; for the glands in contact with it were injured and were dropping off; a film also of albumen of a brown colour, matted with mould, was left. All the gelatine was absorbed, and there was only a little acid secretion left on the midrib. Experiment 7.—A bit of half roasted meat (not measured) and a bit of gelatine were placed on the two ends of a leaf, which [page 303] opened spontaneously after eleven days; a vestige of the meat was left, and the surface of the leaf was here blackened; the gelatine had all disappeared. Experiment 8.—A bit of half roasted meat (not measured) was placed on a leaf which was forcibly kept open by a clip, so that it was moistened with the secretion (very acid) only on its lower surface. Nevertheless, after only 22 1/2 hrs. it was surprisingly softened, when compared with another bit of the same meat which had been kept damp. Experiment 9.—A cube of 1/10 of an inch of very compact roasted beef was placed on a leaf, which opened spontaneously after twelve days; so much feebly acid secretion was left on the leaf that it trickled off. The meat was completely disintegrated, but not all dissolved; there was no mould. The little mass was placed under the microscope; some of the fibrillae in the middle still exhibited transverse striae; others showed not a vestige of striae; and every gradation could be traced between these two states. Globules, apparently of fat, and some undigested fibro-elastic tissue remained. The meat was thus in the same state as that formerly described, which was half digested by Drosera. Here, again, as in the case of albumen, the digestive process seems slower than in Drosera. At the opposite end of the same leaf, a firmly compressed pellet of bread had been placed; this was completely disintegrated, I suppose, owing to the digestion of the gluten, but seemed very little reduced in bulk. Experiment 10.—A cube of 1/20 of an inch of cheese and another of albumen were placed at opposite ends of the same leaf. After nine days the lobes opened spontaneously a little at the end enclosing the cheese, but hardly any or none was dissolved, though it was softened and surrounded by secretion. Two days subsequently the end with the albumen also opened spontaneously (i.e. eleven days after it was put on), a mere trace in a blackened and dry condition being left. Experiment 11.—The same experiment with cheese and albumen repeated on another and rather torpid leaf. The lobes at the end with the cheese, after an interval of six days, opened spontaneously a little; the cube of cheese was much softened, but not dissolved, and but little, if at all, reduced in size. Twelve hours afterwards the end with the albumen opened, which now consisted of a large drop of transparent, not acid, viscid fluid. Experiment 12.—Same experiment as the two last, and here again the leaf at the end enclosing the cheese opened before the [page 304] opposite end with the albumen; but no further observations were made. Experiment 13.—A globule of chemically prepared casein, about 1/10 of an inch in diameter, was placed on a leaf, which spontaneously opened after eight days. The casein now consisted of a soft sticky mass, very little, if at all, reduced in size, but bathed in acid secretion.] These experiments are sufficient to show that the secretion from the glands of Dionaea dissolves albumen, gelatine, and meat, if too large pieces are not given. Globules of fat and fibro-elastic tissue are not digested. The secretion, with its dissolved matter, if not in excess, is subsequently absorbed. On the other hand, although chemically prepared casein and cheese (as in the case of Drosera) excite much acid secretion, owing, I presume, to the absorption of some included albuminous matter, these substances are not digested, and are not appreciably, if at all, reduced in bulk. [Effects of the Vapours of Chloroform, Sulphuric Ether, and Hydrocyanic Acid.—A plant bearing one leaf was introduced into a large bottle with a drachm (3.549 ml.) of chloroform, the mouth being imperfectly closed with cotton-wool. The vapour caused in 1 m. the lobes to begin moving at an imperceptibly slow rate; but in 3 m. the spikes crossed, and the leaf was soon completely shut. The dose, however, was much too large, for in between 2 and 3 hrs. the leaf appeared as if burnt, and soon died. Two leaves were exposed for 30 m. in a 2-oz: vessel to the vapour of 30 minims (1.774 ml.) of sulphuric ether. One leaf closed after a time, as did the other whilst being removed from the vessel without being touched. Both leaves were greatly injured. Another leaf, exposed for 20 m. to 15 minims of ether, closed its lobes to a certain extent, and the sensitive filaments were now quite insensible. After 24 hrs. this leaf recovered its sensibility, but was still rather torpid. A leaf exposed in a large bottle for only 3 m. to ten drops was rendered insensible. After 52 m. it recovered its sensibility, and when one of the filaments was touched, the lobes closed. It began [page 305] to reopen after 20 hrs. Lastly another leaf was exposed for 4 m. to only four drops of the ether; it was rendered insensible, and did not close when its filaments were repeatedly touched, but closed when the end of the open leaf was cut off. This shows either that the internal parts had not been rendered insensible, or that an incision is a more powerful stimulus than repeated touches on the filaments. Whether the larger doses of chloroform and ether, which caused the leaves to close slowly, acted on the sensitive filaments or on the leaf itself, I do not know. Cyanide of potassium, when left in a bottle, generates prussic or hydrocyanic acid. A leaf was exposed for 1 hr. 35 m. to the vapour thus formed; and the glands became within this time so colourless and shrunken as to be scarcely visible, and I at first thought that they had all dropped off. The leaf was not rendered insensible; for as soon as one of the filaments was touched it closed. It had, however, suffered, for it did not reopen until nearly two days had passed, and was not even then in the least sensitive. After an additional day it recovered its powers, and closed on being touched and subsequently reopened. Another leaf behaved in nearly the same manner after a shorter exposure to this vapour.] On the Manner in which Insects are caught.—We will now consider the action of the leaves when insects happen to touch one of the sensitive filaments. This often occurred in my greenhouse, but I do not know whether insects are attracted in any special way by the leaves. They are caught in large numbers by the plant in its native country. As soon as a filament is touched, both lobes close with astonishing quickness; and as they stand at less than a right angle to each other, they have a good chance of catching any intruder. The angle between the blade and footstalk does not change when the lobes close. The chief seat of movement is near the midrib, but is not confined to this part; for, as the lobes come together, each curves inwards across its whole breadth; the marginal spikes however, not becoming curved. This move- [page 306] ment of the whole lobe was well seen in a leaf to which a large fly had been given, and from which a large portion had been cut off the end of one lobe; so that the opposite lobe, meeting with no resistance in this part, went on curving inwards much beyond the medial line. The whole of the lobe, from which a portion had been cut, was afterwards removed, and the opposite lobe now curled completely over, passing through an angle of from 120o to 130o, so as to occupy a position almost at right angles to that which it would have held had the opposite lobe been present. From the curving inwards of the two lobes, as they move towards each other, the straight marginal spikes intercross by their tips at first, and ultimately by their bases. The leaf is then completely shut and encloses a shallow cavity. If it has been made to shut merely by one of the sensitive filaments having been touched, or if it includes an object not yielding soluble nitrogenous matter, the two lobes retain their inwardly concave form until they re-expand. The re-expansion under these circumstances—that is when no organic matter is enclosed—was observed in ten cases. In all of these, the leaves re-expanded to about two-thirds of the full extent in 24 hrs. from the time of closure. Even the leaf from which a portion of one lobe had been cut off opened to a slight degree within this same time. In one case a leaf re-expanded to about two-thirds of the full extent in 7 hrs., and completely in 32 hrs.; but one of its filaments had been touched merely with a hair just enough to cause the leaf to close. Of these ten leaves only a few re-expanded completely in less than two days, and two or three required even a little longer time. Before, however, they fully re-expand, they are ready to close [page 307] instantly if their sensitive filaments are touched. How many times a leaf is capable of shutting and opening if no animal matter is left enclosed, I do not know; but one leaf was made to close four times, reopening afterwards, within six days, On the last occasion it caught a fly, and then remained closed for many days. This power of reopening quickly after the filaments have been accidentally touched by blades of grass, or by objects blown on the leaf by the wind, as occasionally happens in its native place,* must be of some importance to the plant; for as long as a leaf remains closed, it cannot of course capture an insect. When the filaments are irritated and a leaf is made to shut over an insect, a bit of meat, albumen, gelatine, casein, and, no doubt, any other substance containing soluble nitrogenous matter, the lobes, instead of remaining concave, thus including a concavity, slowly press closely together throughout their whole breadth. As this takes place, the margins gradually become a little everted, so that the spikes, which at first intercrossed, at last project in two parallel rows. The lobes press against each other with such force that I have seen a cube of albumen much flattened, with distinct impressions of the little prominent glands; but this latter circumstance may have been partly caused by the corroding action of the secretion. So firmly do they become pressed together that, if any large insect or other object has been caught, a corresponding projection on the outside of the leaf is distinctly visible. When the two lobes are thus completely shut, they * According to Dr. Curtis, in ‘Boston Journal of Nat. Hist,’ vol. i 1837, p. 123. [page 308] resist being opened, as by a thin wedge driven between them, with astonishing force, and are generally ruptured rather than yield. If not ruptured, they close again, as Dr. Canby informs me in a letter, “with quite a loud flap.” But if the end of a leaf is held firmly between the thumb and finger, or by a clip, so that the lobes cannot begin to close, they exert, whilst in this position, very little force. I thought at first that the gradual pressing together of the lobes was caused exclusively by captured insects crawling over and repeatedly irritating the sensitive filaments; and this view seemed the more probable when I learnt from Dr. Burdon Sanderson that whenever the filaments of a closed leaf are irritated, the normal electric current is disturbed. Nevertheless, such irritation is by no means necessary, for a dead insect, or a bit of meat, or of albumen, all act equally well; proving that in these cases it is the absorption of animal matter which excites the lobes slowly to press close together. We have seen that the absorption of an extremely small quantity of such matter also causes a fully expanded leaf to close slowly; and this movement is clearly analogous to the slow pressing together of the concave lobes. This latter action is of high functional importance to the plant, for the glands on both sides are thus brought into contact with a captured insect, and consequently secrete. The secretion with animal matter in solution is then drawn by capillary attraction over the whole surface of the leaf, causing all the glands to secrete and allowing them to absorb the diffused animal matter. The movement, excited by the absorption of such matter, though slow, suffices for its final purpose, whilst the movement excited by one of the sensitive filaments being touched is rapid, and this is indis- [page 309] pensable for the capturing of insects. These two movements, excited by two such widely different means, are thus both well adapted, like all the other functions of the plant, for the purposes which they subserve. There is another wide difference in the action of leaves which enclose objects, such as bits of wood, cork, balls of paper, or which have had their filaments merely touched, and those which enclose organic bodies yielding soluble nitrogenous matter. In the former case the leaves, as we have seen, open in under 24 hrs. and are then ready, even before being fully-expanded, to shut again. But if they have closed over nitrogen-yielding bodies, they remain closely shut for many days; and after re-expanding are torpid, and never act again, or only after a considerable interval of time. In four instances, leaves after catching insects never reopened, but began to wither, remaining closed—in one case for fifteen days over a fly; in a second, for twenty-four days, though the fly was small; in a third for twenty-four days over a woodlouse; and in a fourth, for thirty-five days over a large Tipula. In two other cases leaves remained closed for at least nine days over flies, and for how many more I do not know. It should, however, be added that in two instances in which very small insects had been naturally caught the leaf opened as quickly as if nothing had been caught; and I suppose that this was due to such small insects not having been crushed or not having excreted any animal matter, so that the glands were not excited. Small angular bits of albumen and gelatine were placed at both ends of three leaves, two of which remained closed for thirteen and the other for twelve days. Two other leaves remained closed over bits of [page 310] meat for eleven days, a third leaf for eight days, and a fourth (but this had been cracked and injured) for only six days. Bits of cheese, or casein, were placed at one end and albumen at the other end of three leaves; and the ends with the former opened after six, eight, and nine days, whilst the opposite ends opened a little later. None of the above bits of meat, albumen, &c., exceeded a cube of 1/10 of an inch (2.54 mm.) in size, and were sometimes smaller; yet these small portions sufficed to keep the leaves closed for many days. Dr. Canby informs me that leaves remain shut for a longer time over insects than over meat; and from what I have seen, I can well believe that this is the case, especially if the insects are large. In all the above cases, and in many others in which leaves remained closed for a long but unknown period over insects naturally caught, they were more or less torpid when they reopened. Generally they were so torpid during many succeeding days that no excitement of the filaments caused the least movement. In one instance, however, on the day after a leaf opened which had clasped a fly, it closed with extreme slowness when one of its filaments was touched; and although no object was left enclosed, it was so torpid that it did not re-open for the second time until 44 hrs. had elapsed. In a second case, a leaf which had expanded after remaining closed for at least nine days over a fly, when greatly irritated, moved one alone of its two lobes, and retained this unusual position for the next two days. A third case offers the strongest exception which I have observed; a leaf, after remaining clasped for an unknown time over a fly, opened, and when one of its filaments was touched, closed, though rather slowly. Dr. Canby, [page 311] who observed in the United States a large number of plants which, although not in their native site, were probably more vigorous than my plants, informs me that he has “several times known vigorous leaves to devour their prey several times; but ordinarily twice, or, quite often, once was enough to render them unserviceable.” Mrs. Treat, who cultivated many plants in New Jersey, also informs me that “several leaves caught successively three insects each, but most of them were not able to digest the third fly, but died in the attempt. Five leaves, however, digested each three flies, and closed over the fourth, but died soon after the fourth capture. Many leaves did not digest even one large insect.” It thus appears that the power of digestion is somewhat limited, and it is certain that leaves always remain clasped for many days over an insect, and do not recover their power of closing again for many subsequent days. In this respect Dionaea differs from Drosera, which catches and digests many insects after shorter intervals of time. We are now prepared to understand the use of the marginal spikes, which form so conspicuous a feature in the appearance of the plant (fig. 12, p. 287), and which at first seemed to me in my ignorance useless appendages. From the inward curvature of the lobes as they approach each other, the tips of the marginal spikes first intercross, and ultimately their bases. Until the edges of the lobes come into contact, elongated spaces between the spikes, varying from the 1/15 to the 1/10 of an inch (1.693 to 2.54 mm.) in breadth, according to the size of the leaf, are left open. Thus an insect, if its body is not thicker than these measurements, can easily escape between the crossed spikes, when disturbed by the closing lobes and in- [page 312] creasing darkness; and one of my sons actually saw a small insect thus escaping. A moderately large insect, on the other hand, if it tries to escape between the bars will surely be pushed back again into its horrid prison with closing walls, for the spikes continue to cross more and more until the edges of the lobes come into contact. A very strong insect, however, would be able to free itself, and Mrs. Treat saw this effected by a rose-chafer (Macrodactylus subspinosus) in the United States. Now it would manifestly be a great disadvantage to the plant to waste many days in remaining clasped over a minute insect, and several additional days or weeks in afterwards recovering its sensibility; inasmuch as a minute insect would afford but little nutriment. It would be far better for the plant to wait for a time until a moderately large insect was captured, and to allow all the little ones to escape; and this advantage is secured by the slowly intercrossing marginal spikes, which act like the large meshes of a fishing-net, allowing the small and useless fry to escape. As I was anxious to know whether this view was correct—and as it seems a good illustration of how cautious we ought to be in assuming, as I had done with respect to the marginal spikes, that any fully developed structure is useless—I applied to Dr. Canby. He visited the native site of the plant, early in the season, before the leaves had grown to their full size, and sent me fourteen leaves, containing naturally captured insects. Four of these had caught rather small insects, viz. three of them ants, and the fourth a rather small fly, but the other ten had all caught large insects, namely, five elaters, two chrysomelas, a curculio, a thick and broad spider, and a scolopendra. Out of these ten insects, no less than eight [page 313] were beetles,* and out of the whole fourteen there was only one, viz. a dipterous insect, which could readily take flight. Drosera, on the other hand, lives chiefly on insects which are good flyers, especially Diptera, caught by the aid of its viscid secretion. But what most concerns us is the size of the ten larger insects. Their average length from head to tail was .256 of an inch, the lobes of the leaves being on an average .53 of an inch in length, so that the insects were very nearly half as long as the leaves within which they were enclosed. Only a few of these leaves, therefore, had wasted their powers by capturing small prey, though it is probable that many small insects had crawled over them and been caught, but had then escaped through the bars. The Transmission of the Motor Impulse, and Means of Movement.—It is sufficient to touch any one of the six filaments to cause both lobes to close, these becoming at the same time incurved throughout their whole breadth. The stimulus must therefore radiate in all directions from any one filament. It must also be transmitted with much rapidity across the leaf, for in all ordinary cases both lobes close simultaneously, as far as the eye can judge. Most physiologists believe that in irritable plants the excitement is transmitted along, or in close connection with, the fibro-vascular bundles. In Dionaea, the course of these vessels (composed of spiral and ordinary vascular * Dr. Canby remarks (‘Gardener’s Monthly,’ August 1868), “as a general thing beetles and insects of that kind, though always killed, seem to be too hard-shelled to serve as food, and after a short time are rejected.” I am surprised at this statement, at least with respect to such beetles as elaters, for the five which I examined were in an extremely fragile and empty condition, as if all their internal parts had been partially digested. Mrs. Treat informs me that the plants which she cultivated in New Jersey chiefly caught Diptera. [page 314] tissue) seems at first sight to favour this belief; for they run up the midrib in a great bundle, sending off small bundles almost at right angles on each side. These bifurcate occasionally as they extend towards the margin, and close to the margin small branches from adjoining vessels unite and enter the marginal spikes. At some of these points of union the vessels form curious loops, like those described under Drosera. A continuous zigzag line of vessels thus runs round the whole circumference of the leaf, and in the midrib all the vessels are in close contact; so that all parts of the leaf seem to be brought into some degree of communication. Nevertheless, the presence of vessels is not necessary for the transmission of the motor impulse, for it is transmitted from the tips of the sensitive filaments (these being about the 1/20 of an inch in length), into which no vessels enter; and these could not have been overlooked, as I made thin vertical sections of the leaf at the bases of the filaments. On several occasions, slits about the 1/10 of an inch in length were made with a lancet, close to the bases of the filaments, parallel to the midrib, and, therefore, directly across the course of the vessels. These were made sometimes on the inner and sometimes on the outer sides of the filaments; and after several days, when the leaves had reopened, these filaments were touched roughly (for they were always rendered in some degree torpid by the operation), and the lobes then closed in the ordinary manner, though slowly, and sometimes not until after a considerable interval of time. These cases show that the motor impulse is not transmitted along the vessels, and they further show that there is no necessity for a direct line of communication from the filament which is [page 315] touched towards the midrib and opposite lobe, or towards the outer parts of the same lobe. Two slits near each other, both parallel to the midrib, were next made in the same manner as before, one on each side of the base of a filament, on five distinct leaves, so that a little slip bearing a filament was connected with the rest of the leaf only at its two ends. These slips were nearly of the same size; one was carefully measured; it was .12 of an inch (3.048 mm.) in length, and .08 of an inch (2.032 mm.) in breadth; and in the middle stood the filament. Only one of these slips withered and perished. After the leaf had recovered from the operation, though the slits were still open, the filaments thus circumstanced were roughly touched, and both lobes, or one alone, slowly closed. In two instances touching the filament produced no effect; but when the point of a needle was driven into the slip at the base of the filament, the lobes slowly closed. Now in these cases the impulse must have proceeded along the slip in a line parallel to the midrib, and then have radiated forth, either from both ends or from one end alone of the slip, over the whole surface of the two lobes. Again, two parallel slits, like the former ones, were made, one on each side of the base of a filament, at right angles to the midrib. After the leaves (two in number) had recovered, the filaments were roughly touched, and the lobes slowly closed; and here the impulse must have travelled for a short distance in a line at right angles to the midrib, and then have radiated forth on all sides over both lobes. These several cases prove that the motor impulse travels in all directions through the cellular tissue, independently of the course of the vessels. With Drosera we have seen that the motor impulse [page 316] is transmitted in like manner in all directions through the cellular tissue; but that its rate is largely governed by the length of the cells and the direction of their longer axes. Thin sections of a leaf of Dionaea were made by my son, and the cells, both those of the central and of the more superficial layers, were found much elongated, with their longer axes directed towards the midrib; and it is in this direction that the motor impulse must be sent with great rapidity from one lobe to the other, as both close simultaneously. The central parenchymatous cells are larger, more loosely attached together, and have more delicate walls than the more superficial cells. A thick mass of cellular tissue forms the upper surface of the midrib over the great central bundle of vessels. When the filaments were roughly touched, at the bases of which slits had been made, either on both sides or on one side, parallel to the midrib or at right angles to it, the two lobes, or only one, moved. In one of these cases, the lobe on the side which bore the filament that was touched moved, but in three other cases the opposite lobe alone moved; so that an injury which was sufficient to prevent a lobe moving did not prevent the transmission from it of a stimulus which excited the opposite lobe to move. We thus also learn that, although normally both lobes move together, each has the power of independent movement. A case, indeed, has already been given of a torpid leaf that had lately re-opened after catching an insect, of which one lobe alone moved when irritated. Moreover, one end of the same lobe can close and re- expand, independently of the other end, as was seen in some of the foregoing experiments. When the lobes, which are rather thick, close, no trace of wrinkling can be seen on any part of their upper [page 317] surfaces, It appears therefore that the cells must contract. The chief seat of the movement is evidently in the thick mass of cells which overlies the central bundle of vessels in the midrib. To ascertain whether this part contracts, a leaf was fastened on the stage of the microscope in such a manner that the two lobes could not become quite shut, and having made two minute black dots on the midrib, in a transverse line and a little towards one side, they were found by the micrometer to be 17/1000 of an inch apart. One of the filaments was then touched and the lobes closed; but as they were prevented from meeting, I could still see the two dots, which now were 15/1000 of an inch apart, so that a small portion of the upper surface of the midrib had contracted in a transverse line 2/1000 of an inch (.0508 mm.). We know that the lobes, whilst closing, become slightly incurved throughout their whole breadth. This movement appears to be due to the contraction of the superficial layers of cells over the whole upper surface. In order to observe their contraction, a narrow strip was cut out of one lobe at right angles to the midrib, so that the surface of the opposite lobe could be seen in this part when the leaf was shut. After the leaf had recovered from the operation and had re-expanded, three minute black dots were made on the surface opposite to the slit or window, in a line at right angles to the midrib. The distance between the dots was found to be 40/1000 of an inch, so that the two extreme dots were 80/1000 of an inch apart. One of the filaments was now touched and the leaf closed. On again measuring the distances between the dots, the two next to the midrib were nearer together by 1 to 2/1000 of an inch, and the two further dots by 3 to 4/1000 of an inch, than they were before; so that the two extreme [page 318] dots now stood about 5/1000 of an inch (.127 mm.) nearer together than before. If we suppose the whole upper surface of the lobe, which was 400/1000 of an inch in breadth, to have contracted in the same proportion, the total contraction will have amounted to about 25/1000 or 1/40 of an inch (.635 mm.); but whether this is sufficient to account for the slight inward curvature of the whole lobe, I am unable to say. Finally, with respect to the movement of the leaves, the wonderful discovery made by Dr. Burdon Sanderson* is now universally known; namely that there exists a normal electrical current in the blade and footstalk; and that when the leaves are irritated, the current is disturbed in the same manner as takes place during the contraction of the muscle of an animal. The Re-expansion of the Leaves.—This is effected at an insensibly slow rate, whether or not any object is enclosed.** One lobe can re-expand by itself, as occurred with the torpid leaf of which one lobe alone had closed. We have also seen in the experiments with cheese and albumen that the two ends of the same lobe can re-expand to a certain extent independently of each other. But in all ordinary cases both lobes open at the same time. The re-expansion is not determined by the sensitive filaments; all three filaments on one lobe were cut off close to their bases; and the three * Proc. Royal Soc.’ vol. xxi. p. 495; and lecture at the Royal Institution, June 5, 1874, given in ‘Nature,’ 1874, pp. 105 and 127. ** Nuttall, in his ‘Gen. American Plants,’ p. 277 (note), says that, whilst collecting this plant in its native home, “I had occasion to observe that a detached leaf would make repeated efforts towards disclosing itself to the influence of the sun; these attempts consisted in an undulatory motion of the marginal ciliae, accompanied by a partial opening and succeeding collapse of the lamina, which at length terminated in a complete expansion and in the destruction of sensibility.” I am indebted to Prof. Oliver for this reference; but I do not understand what took place. [page 319] leaves thus treated re-expanded,—one to a partial extent in 24 hrs.,—a second to the same extent in 48 hrs., and the third, which had been previously injured, not until the sixth day. These leaves after their re-expansion closed quickly when the filaments on the other lobe were irritated. These were then cut off one of the leaves, so that none were left. This mutilated leaf, notwithstanding the loss of all its filaments, re-expanded in two days in the usual manner. When the filaments have been excited by immersion in a solution of sugar, the lobes do not expand so soon as when the filaments have been merely touched; and this, I presume, is due to their having been strongly affected through exosmose, so that they continue for some time to transmit a motor impulse to the upper surface of the leaf. The following facts make me believe that the several layers of cells forming the lower surface of the leaf are always in a state of tension; and that it is owing to this mechanical state, aided probably by fresh fluid being attracted into the cells, that the lobes begin to separate or expand as soon as the contraction of the upper surface diminishes. A leaf was cut off and suddenly plunged perpendicularly into boiling water: I expected that the lobes would have closed, but instead of doing so, they diverged a little. I then took another fine leaf, with the lobes standing at an angle of nearly 80o to each other; and on immersing it as before, the angle suddenly increased to 90o. A third leaf was torpid from having recently re-expanded after having caught a fly, so that repeated touches of the filaments caused not the least movement; nevertheless, when similarly immersed, the lobes separated a little. As these leaves were inserted perpendicularly into the boiling water, both surfaces and the filaments [page 320] must have been equally affected; and I can understand the divergence of the lobes only by supposing that the cells on the lower side, owing to their state of tension, acted mechanically and thus suddenly drew the lobes a little apart, as soon as the cells on the upper surface were killed and lost their contractile power. We have seen that boiling water in like manner causes the tentacles of Drosera to curve backwards; and this is an analogous movement to the divergence of the lobes of Dionaea. In some concluding remarks in the fifteenth chapter on the Droseraceae, the different kinds of irritability possessed by the several genera, and the different manner in which they capture insects, will be compared.

Captures crustaceans—Structure of the leaves in comparison with those of Dionaea— Absorption by the glands, by the quadrifid processes, and points on the infolded margins— Aldrovanda vesiculosa, var. australis—Captures prey—Absorption of animal matter—Aldrovanda vesiculosa, var. verticillata—Concluding remarks. This plant may be called a miniature aquatic Dionaea. Stein discovered in 1873 that the bilobed leaves, which are generally found closed in Europe, open under a sufficiently high temperature, and, when touched, suddenly close.* They re-expand in from 24 to 36 hours, but only, as it appears, when inorganic objects are enclosed. The leaves sometimes contain bubbles of air, and were formerly supposed to be bladders; hence the specific name of vesiculosa. Stein observed that water-insects were sometimes caught, and Prof. Cohn has recently found within the leaves of naturally growing plants many kinds of crustaceans and larvæ.** Plants which had been kept in filtered water were placed by him in a vessel con- * Since his original publication, Stein has found out that the irritability of the leaves was observed by De Sassus, as recorded in ‘Bull. Bot. Soc. de France,’ in 1861. Delpino states in a paper published in 1871 (‘Nuovo Giornale Bot. Ital.’ vol. iii. p. 174) that “una quantit di chioccioline e di altri animalcoli acquatici” are caught and suffocated by the leaves. I presume that chioccioline are fresh-water molluscs. It would be interesting to know whether their shells are at all corroded by the acid of the digestive secretion. ** I am greatly indebted to this distinguished naturalist for having sent me a copy of his memoir on Aldrovanda, before its publication in his ‘Beiträge zur Biologie der Pflanzen,’ drittes Heft, 1875, page 71. [page 322] taining numerous crustaceans of the genus Cypris, and next morning many were found imprisoned and alive, still swimming about within the closed leaves, but doomed to certain death. Directly after reading Prof. Cohn’s memoir, I received through the kindness of Dr. Hooker living plants from Germany. As I can add nothing to Prof. Cohn’s excellent description, I will give only two illustrations, one of a whorl of leaves copied from his work, and the other of a leaf pressed flat open, drawn by my son Francis. I will, however, append a few remarks on the differences between this plant and Dionaea. Aldrovanda is destitute of roots and floats freely in the water. The leaves are arranged in whorls round the stem. Their broad petioles terminate in from four to six rigid projections,* each tipped with a stiff, short bristle. The bilobed leaf, with the midrib likewise tipped with a bristle, stands in the midst of these projections, and is evidently defended by them. The lobes are formed of very delicate tissue, so as to be translucent; they open, according to Cohn, about as much as the two valves of a living mussel-shell, therefore even less than the lobes of Dionaea; and this must make the capture of aquatic animals more easy. The outside of the leaves and the petioles are covered with minute two-armed papillae, evidently answering to the eight-rayed papillae of Dionaea. Each lobe rather exceeds a semi-circle in convexity, and consists of two very different concentric portions; the inner and lesser portion, or that next to the midrib, * There has been much discussion by botanists on the homological nature of these projections. Dr. Nitschke (‘Bot. Zeitung,’ 1861, p. 146) believes that they correspond with the fimbriated scale-like bodies found at the bases of the petioles of Drosera. [page 323] is slightly concave, and is formed, according to Cohn, of three layers of cells. Its upper surface is studded with colourless glands like, but more simple than, those of Dionaea; they are supported on distinct footstalks, consisting of two rows of cells. The outer FIG. 13. (Aldrovanda vesiculosa.) Upper figure, whorl of leaves (from Prof. Cohn). Lower figure, leaf pressed flat open and greatly enlarged. and broader portion of the lobe is flat and very thin, being formed of only two layers of cells. Its upper surface does not bear any glands, but, in their place, small quadrifid processes, each consisting of four tapering projections, which rise from a common [page 324] prominence. These processes are formed of very delicate membrane lined with a layer of protoplasm; and they sometimes contain aggregated globules of hyaline matter. Two of the slightly diverging arms are directed towards the circumference, and two towards the midrib, forming together a sort of Greek cross. Occasionally two of the arms are replaced by one, and then the projection is trifid. We shall see in a future chapter that these projections curiously resemble those found within the bladders of Utricularia, more especially of Utricularia montana, although this genus is not related to Aldrovanda. A narrow rim of the broad flat exterior part of each lobe is turned inwards, so that, when the lobes are closed, the exterior surfaces of the infolded portions come into contact. The edge itself bears a row of conical, flattened, transparent points with broad bases, like the prickles on the stem of a bramble or Rubus. As the rim is infolded, these points are directed towards the midrib, and they appear at first as if they were adapted to prevent the escape of prey; but this can hardly be their chief function, for they are composed of very delicate and highly flexible membrane, which can be easily bent or quite doubled back without being cracked. Nevertheless, the infolded rims, together with the points, must somewhat interfere with the retrograde movement of any small creature, as soon as the lobes begin to close. The circumferential part of the leaf of Aldrovanda thus differs greatly from that of Dionaea; nor can the points on the rim be considered as homologous with the spikes round the leaves of Dionaea, as these latter are prolongations of the blade, and not mere epidermic productions. They appear also to serve for a widely different purpose. [page 325] On the concave gland-bearing portion of the lobes, and especially on the midrib, there are numerous, long, finely pointed hairs, which, as Prof. Cohn remarks, there can be little doubt are sensitive to a touch, and, when touched, cause the leaf to close. They are formed of two rows of cells, or, according to Cohn, sometimes of four, and do not include any vascular tissue. They differ also from the six sensitive filaments of Dionaea in being colourless, and in having a medial as well as a basal articulation. No doubt it is owing to these two articulations that, notwithstanding their length, they escape being broken when the lobes close. The plants which I received during the early part of October from Kew never opened their leaves, though subjected to a high temperature. After examining the structure of some of them, I experimented on only two, as I hoped that the plants would grow; and I now regret that I did not sacrifice a greater number. A leaf was cut open along the midrib, and the glands examined under a high power. It was then placed in a few drops of an infusion of raw meat. After 3 hrs. 20 m. there was no change, but when next examined after 23 hrs. 20 m., the outer cells of the glands contained, instead of limpid fluid, spherical masses of a granular substance, showing that matter had been absorbed from the infusion. That these glands secrete a fluid which dissolves or digests animal matter out of the bodies of the creatures which the leaves capture, is also highly probable from the analogy of Dionaea. If we may trust to the same analogy, the concave and inner portions of the two lobes probably close together by a slow movement, as soon as the glands have absorbed a slight amount of [page 326] already soluble animal matter. The included water would thus be pressed out, and the secretion consequently not be too much diluted to act. With respect to the quadrifid processes on the outer parts of the lobes, I was not able to decide whether they had been acted on by the infusion; for the lining of protoplasm was somewhat shrunk before they were immersed. Many of the points on the infolded rims also had their lining of protoplasm similarly shrunk, and contained spherical granules of hyaline matter. A solution of urea was next employed. This substance was chosen partly because it is absorbed by the quadrifid processes and more especially by the glands of Utricularia—a plant which, as we shall hereafter see, feeds on decayed animal matter. As urea is one of the last products of the chemical changes going on in the living body, it seems fitted to represent the early stages of the decay of the dead body. I was also led to try urea from a curious little fact mentioned by Prof. Cohn, namely that when rather large crustaceans are caught between the closing lobes, they are pressed so hard whilst making their escape that they often void their sausage-shaped masses of excrement, which were found within most of the leaves. These masses, no doubt, contain urea. They would be left either on the broad outer surfaces of the lobes where the quadrifids are situated, or within the closed concavity. In the latter case, water charged with excrementitious and decaying matter would be slowly forced outwards, and would bathe the quadrifids, if I am right in believing that the concave lobes contract after a time like those of Dionaea. Foul water would also be apt to ooze out at all times, especially when bubbles of air were generated within the concavity. A leaf was cut open and examined, and the outer [page 327] cells of the glands were found to contain only limpid fluid. Some of the quadrifids included a few spherical granules, but several were transparent and empty, and their positions were marked. This leaf was now immersed in a little solution of one part of urea to 146 of water, or three grains to the ounce. After 3 hrs. 40 m. there was no change either in the glands or quadrifids; nor was there any certain change in the glands after 24 hrs.; so that, as far as one trial goes, urea does not act on them in the same manner as an infusion of raw meat. It was different with the quadrifids; for the lining of protoplasm, instead of presenting a uniform texture, was now slightly shrunk, and exhibited in many places minute, thickened, irregular, yellowish specks and ridges, exactly like those which appear within the quadrifids of Utricularia when treated with this same solution. Moreover, several of the quadrifids, which were before empty, now contained moderately sized or very small, more or less aggregated, globules of yellowish matter, as likewise occurs under the same circumstances with Utricularia. Some of the points on the infolded margins of the lobes were similarly affected; for their lining of protoplasm was a little shrunk and included yellowish specks; and those which were before empty now contained small spheres and irregular masses of hyaline matter, more or less aggregated; so that both the points on the margins and the quadrifids had absorbed matter from the solution in the course of 24 hrs.; but to this subject I shall recur. In another rather old leaf, to which nothing had been given, but which had been kept in foul water, some of the quadrifids contained aggregated translucent globules. These were not acted on by a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 218 of water; and this negative result [page 328] agrees with what I have observed under similar circumstances with Utricularia. Aldrovanda vesiculosa, var. australis.—Dried leaves of this plant from Queensland in Australia were sent me by Prof. Oliver from the herbarium at Kew. Whether it ought to be considered as a distinct species or a variety, cannot be told until the flowers are examined by a botanist. The projections at the upper end of the petiole (from four to six in number) are considerably longer relatively to the blade, and much more attenuated than those of the European form. They are thickly covered for a considerable space near their extremities with the upcurved prickles, which are quite absent in the latter form; and they generally bear on their tips two or three straight prickles instead of one. The bilobed leaf appears also to be rather larger and somewhat broader, with the pedicel by which it is attached to the upper end of the petiole a little longer. The points on the infolded margins likewise differ; they have narrower bases, and are more pointed; long and short points also alternate with much more regularity than in the European form. The glands and sensitive hairs are similar in the two forms. No quadrifid processes could be seen on several of the leaves, but I do not doubt that they were present, though indistinguishable from their delicacy and from having shrivelled; for they were quite distinct on one leaf under circumstances presently to be mentioned. Some of the closed leaves contained no prey, but in one there was a rather large beetle, which from its flattened tibiae I suppose was an aquatic species, but was not allied to Colymbetes. All the softer tissues of this beetle were completely dissolved, and its chitinous integuments were as clean as if they had been [page 329] boiled in caustic potash; so that it must have been enclosed for a considerable time. The glands were browner and more opaque than those on other leaves which had caught nothing; and the quadrifid processes, from being partly filled with brown granular matter, could be plainly distinguished, which was not the case, as already stated, on the other leaves. Some of the points on the infolded margins likewise contained brownish granular matter. We thus gain additional evidence that the glands, the quadrifid processes, and the marginal points, all have the power of absorbing matter, though probably of a different nature. Within another leaf disintegrated remnants of a rather small animal, not a crustacean, which had simple, strong, opaque mandibles, and a large unarticulated chitinous coat, were present. Lumps of black organic matter, possibly of a vegetable nature, were enclosed in two other leaves; but in one of these there was also a small worm much decayed. But the nature of partially digested and decayed bodies, which have been pressed flat, long dried, and then soaked in water, cannot be recognised easily. All the leaves contained unicellular and other Algae, still of a greenish colour, which had evidently lived as intruders, in the same manner as occurs, according to Cohn, within the leaves of this plant in Germany. Aldrovanda vesiculosa, var. verticillata.—Dr. King, Superintendent of the Botanic Gardens, kindly sent me dried specimens collected near Calcutta. This form was, I believe, considered by Wallich as a distinct species, under the name of verticillata. It resembles the Australian form much more nearly than the European; namely in the projections at the upper end of the petiole being much attenuated and covered with [page 330] upcurved prickles; they terminate also in two straight little prickles. The bilobed leaves are, I believe, larger and certainly broader even than those of the Australian form; so that the greater convexity of their margins was conspicuous. The length of an open leaf being taken at 100, the breadth of the Bengal form is nearly 173, of the Australian form 147, and of the German 134. The points on the infolded margins are like those in the Australian form. Of the few leaves which were examined, three contained entomostracan crustaceans. Concluding Remarks.—The leaves of the three foregoing closely allied species or varieties are manifestly adapted for catching living creatures. With respect to the functions of the several parts, there can be little doubt that the long jointed hairs are sensitive, like those of Dionaea, and that, when touched, they cause the lobes to close. That the glands secrete a true digestive fluid and afterwards absorb the digested matter, is highly probable from the analogy of Dionaea,—from the limpid fluid within their cells being aggregated into spherical masses, after they had absorbed an infusion of raw meat,—from their opaque and granular condition in the leaf, which had enclosed a beetle for a long time,—and from the clean condition of the integuments of this insect, as well as of crustaceans (as described by Cohn), which have been long captured. Again, from the effect produced on the quadrifid processes by an immersion for 24 hrs. in a solution of urea,—from the presence of brown granular matter within the quadrifids of the leaf in which the beetle had been caught,—and from the analogy of Utricularia,—it is probable that these processes absorb excrementitious and decaying animal matter. It is a more curious fact that the points on [page 331] the infolded margins apparently serve to absorb decayed animal matter in the same manner as the quadrifids. We can thus understand the meaning of the infolded margins of the lobes furnished with delicate points directed inwards, and of the broad, flat, outer portions, bearing quadrifid processes; for these surfaces must be liable to be irrigated by foul water flowing from the concavity of the leaf when it contains dead animals. This would follow from various causes,—from the gradual contraction of the concavity,—from fluid in excess being secreted,—and from the generation of bubbles of air. More observations are requisite on this head; but if this view is correct, we have the remarkable case of different parts of the same leaf serving for very different purposes—one part for true digestion, and another for the absorption of decayed animal matter. We can thus also understand how, by the gradual loss of either power, a plant might be gradually adapted for the one function to the exclusion of the other; and it will hereafter be shown that two genera, namely Pinguicula and Utricularia, belonging to the same family, have been adapted for these two different functions.

Drosophyllum lusitanicum.—This rare plant has been found only in Portugal, and, as I hear from Dr. Hooker, in Morocco. I obtained living specimens through the great kindness of Mr. W.C. Tait, and afterwards from Mr. G. Maw and Dr. Moore. Mr. Tait informs me that it grows plentifully on the sides of dry hills near Oporto, and that vast numbers of flies adhere to the leaves. This latter fact is well-known to the villagers, who call the plant the “fly-catcher,” and hang it up in their cottages for this purpose. A plant in my hot-house caught so many insects during the early part of April, although the weather was cold and insects scarce, that it must have been in some manner strongly attractive to them. On four leaves of a young and small plant, 8, 10, 14, and 16 minute insects, chiefly Diptera, were found in the autumn adhering to them. I neglected to examine the roots, but I hear from Dr. Hooker that they are very small, as in the case of the previously mentioned members of the same family of the Droseraceae. The leaves arise from an almost woody axis; they [page 333] are linear, much attenuated towards their tips, and several inches in length. The upper surface is concave, the lower convex, with a narrow channel down the middle. Both surfaces, with the exception of the channel, are covered with glands, supported on pedicels and arranged in irregular longitudinal rows. These organs I shall call tentacles, from their close resemblance to those of Drosera, though they have no power of movement. Those on the same leaf differ much in length. The glands also differ in size, and are of a bright pink or of a purple colour; their upper surfaces are convex, and the lower flat or even concave, so that they resemble miniature mushrooms in appearance. They are formed of two (as I believe) layers of delicate angular cells, enclosing eight or ten larger cells with thicker, zigzag walls. Within these larger cells there are others marked by spiral lines, and apparently connected with the spiral vessels which run up the green multi-cellular pedicels. The glands secrete large drops of viscid secretion. Other glands, having the same general appearance, are found on the flower-peduncles and calyx. FIG. 14. (Drosophyllum lusitanicum.) Part of leaf, enlarged seven times, showing lower surface. Besides the glands which are borne on longer or shorter pedicels, there are numerous ones, both on the upper and lower surfaces of the leaves, so small as to be scarcely visible to the naked eye. They are colourless and almost sessile, either circular or oval in outline; the latter occurring chiefly on the backs of the leaves (fig. 14). Internally they have exactly the same structure as the larger glands which are supported on pedicels; [page 334] and indeed the two sets almost graduate into one another. But the sessile glands differ in one important respect, for they never secrete spontaneously, as far as I have seen, though I have examined them under a high power on a hot day, whilst the glands on pedicels were secreting copiously. Nevertheless, if little bits of damp albumen or fibrin are placed on these sessile glands, they begin after a time to secrete, in the same manner as do the glands of Dionaea when similarly treated. When they were merely rubbed with a bit of raw meat, I believe that they likewise secreted. Both the sessile glands and the taller ones on pedicels have the power of rapidly absorbing nitrogenous matter. The secretion from the taller glands differs in a remarkable manner from that of Drosera, in being acid before the glands have been in any way excited; and judging from the changed colour of litmus paper, more strongly acid than that of Drosera. This fact was observed repeatedly; on one occasion I chose a young leaf, which was not secreting freely, and had never caught an insect, yet the secretion on all the glands coloured litmus paper of a bright red. From the quickness with which the glands are able to obtain animal matter from such substances as well-washed fibrin and cartilage, I suspect that a small quantity of the proper ferment must be present in the secretion before the glands are excited, so that a little animal matter is quickly dissolved. Owing to the nature of the secretion or to the shape of the glands, the drops are removed from them with singular facility. It is even somewhat difficult, by the aid of a finely pointed polished needle, slightly damped with water, to place a minute particle of any kind on one of the drops; for on withdrawing the [page 335] needle, the drop is generally withdrawn; whereas with Drosera there is no such difficulty, though the drops are occasionally withdrawn. From this peculiarity, when a small insect alights on a leaf of Drosophyllum, the drops adhere to its wings, feet, or body, and are drawn from the gland; the insect then crawls onward and other drops adhere to it; so that at last, bathed by the viscid secretion, it sinks down and dies, resting on the small sessile glands with which the surface of the leaf is thickly covered. In the case of Drosera, an insect sticking to one or more of the exterior glands is carried by their movement to the centre of the leaf; with Drosophyllum, this is effected by the crawling of the insect, as from its wings being clogged by the secretion it cannot fly away. There is another difference in function between the glands of these two plants: we know that the glands of Drosera secrete more copiously when properly excited. But when minute particles of carbonate of ammonia, drops of a solution of this salt or of the nitrate of ammonia, saliva, small insects, bits of raw or roast meat, albumen, fibrin or cartilage, as well as inorganic particles, were placed on the glands of Drosophyllum, the amount of secretion never appeared to be in the least increased. As insects do not commonly adhere to the taller glands, but withdraw the secretion, we can see that there would be little use in their having acquired the habit of secreting copiously when stimulated; whereas with Drosera this is of use, and the habit has been acquired. Nevertheless, the glands of Drosophyllum, without being stimulated, continually secrete, so as to replace the loss by evaporation. Thus when a plant was placed under a small bell-glass with its inner surface and support thoroughly wetted, there was no loss by evaporation, and so much [page 336] secretion was accumulated in the course of a day that it ran down the tentacles and covered large spaces of the leaves. The glands to which the above named nitrogenous substances and liquids were given did not, as just stated, secrete more copiously; on the contrary, they absorbed their own drops of secretion with surprising quickness. Bits of damp fibrin were placed on five glands, and when they were looked at after an interval of 1 hr. 12 m., the fibrin was almost dry, the secretion having been all absorbed. So it was with three cubes of albumen after 1 hr. 19 m., and with four other cubes, though these latter were not looked at until 2 hrs. 15 m. had elapsed. The same result followed in between 1 hr. 15 m. and 1 hr. 30 m. when particles both of cartilage and meat were placed on several glands. Lastly, a minute drop (about 1/20 of a minim) of a solution of one part of nitrate of ammonia to 146 of water was distributed between the secretion surrounding three glands, so that the amount of fluid surrounding each was slightly increased; yet when looked at after 2 hrs., all three were dry. On the other hand, seven particles of glass and three of coal-cinders, of nearly the same size as those of the above named organic substances, were placed on ten glands; some of them being observed for 18 hrs., and others for two or three days; but there was not the least sign of the secretion being absorbed. Hence, in the former cases, the absorption of the secretion must have been due to the presence of some nitrogenous matter, which was either already soluble or was rendered so by the secretion. As the fibrin was pure, and had been well washed in distilled water after being kept in glycerine, and as the cartilage had been soaked in water, I suspect that these substances must [page 337] have been slightly acted on and rendered soluble within the above stated short periods. The glands have not only the power of rapid absorption, but likewise of secreting again quickly; and this latter habit has perhaps been gained, inasmuch as insects, if they touch the glands, generally withdraw the drops of secretion, which have to be restored. The exact period of re-secretion was recorded in only a few cases. The glands on which bits of meat were placed, and which were nearly dry after about 1 hr. 30 m., when looked at after 22 additional hours, were found secreting; so it was after 24 hrs. with one gland on which a bit of albumen had been placed. The three glands to which a minute drop of a solution of nitrate of ammonia was distributed, and which became dry after 2 hrs., were beginning to re-secrete after only 12 additional hours. Tentacles Incapable of Movement.—Many of the tall tentacles, with insects adhering to them, were carefully observed; and fragments of insects, bits of raw meat, albumen, &c., drops of a solution of two salts of ammonia and of saliva, were placed on the glands of many tentacles; but not a trace of movement could ever be detected. I also repeatedly irritated the glands with a needle, and scratched and pricked the blades, but neither the blade nor the tentacles became at all inflected. We may therefore conclude that they are incapable of movement. On the Power of Absorption possessed by the Glands.—It has already been indirectly shown that the glands on pedicels absorb animal matter; and this is further shown by their changed colour, and by the aggregation of their contents, after they have been left in contact with nitrogenous substances or liquids. The following observations apply both to the glands supported on [page 338] pedicels and to the minute sessile ones. Before a gland has been in any way stimulated, the exterior cells commonly contain only limpid purple fluid; the more central ones including mulberry-like masses of purple granular matter. A leaf was placed in a little solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 146 of water (3 grs. to 1 oz.), and the glands were instantly darkened and very soon became black; this change being due to the strongly marked aggregation of their contents, more especially of the inner cells. Another leaf was placed in a solution of the same strength of nitrate of ammonia, and the glands were slightly darkened in 25 m., more so in 50 m., and after 1 hr. 30 m. were of so dark a red as to appear almost black. Other leaves were placed in a weak infusion of raw meat and in human saliva, and the glands were much darkened in 25 m., and after 40 m. were so dark as almost to deserve to be called black. Even immersion for a whole day in distilled water occasionally induces some aggregation within the glands, so that they become of a darker tint. In all these cases the glands are affected in exactly the same manner as those of Drosera. Milk, however, which acts so energetically on Drosera, seems rather less effective on Drosophyllum, for the glands were only slightly darkened by an immersion of 1 hr. 20 m., but became decidedly darker after 3 hrs. Leaves which had been left for 7 hrs. in an infusion of raw meat or in saliva were placed in the solution of carbonate of ammonia, and the glands now became greenish; whereas, if they had been first placed in the carbonate, they would have become black. In this latter case, the ammonia probably combines with the acid of the secretion, and therefore does not act on the colouring matter; but when the glands are first subjected to an organic [page 339] fluid, either the acid is consumed in the work of digestion or the cell-walls are rendered more permeable, so that the undecomposed carbonate enters and acts on the colouring matter. If a particle of the dry carbonate is placed on a gland, the purple colour is quickly discharged, owing probably to an excess of the salt. The gland, moreover, is killed. Turning now to the action of organic substances, the glands on which bits of raw meat were placed became dark-coloured; and in 18 hrs. their contents were conspicuously aggregated. Several glands with bits of albumen and fibrin were darkened in between 2 hrs. and 3 hrs.; but in one case the purple colour was completely discharged. Some glands which had caught flies were compared with others close by; and though they did not differ much in colour, there was a marked difference in their state of aggregation. In some few instances, however, there was no such difference, and this appeared to be due to the insects having been caught long ago, so that the glands had recovered their pristine state. In one case, a group of the sessile colourless glands, to which a small fly adhered, presented a peculiar appearance; for they had become purple, owing to purple granular matter coating the cell-walls. I may here mention as a caution that, soon after some of my plants arrived in the spring from Portugal, the glands were not plainly acted on by bits of meat, or insects, or a solution of ammonia—a circumstance for which I cannot account. Digestion of Solid Animal Matter.—Whilst I was trying to place on two of the taller glands little cubes of albumen, these slipped down, and, besmeared with secretion, were left resting on some of the small sessile glands. After 24 hrs. one of these cubes was found [page 340] completely liquefied, but with a few white streaks still visible; the other was much rounded, but not quite dissolved. Two other cubes were left on tall glands for 2 hrs. 45 m., by which time all the secretion was absorbed; but they were not perceptibly acted on, though no doubt some slight amount of animal matter had been absorbed from them. They were then placed on the small sessile glands, which being thus stimulated secreted copiously in the course of 7 hrs. One of these cubes was much liquefied within this short time; and both were completely liquefied after 21 hrs. 15 m.; the little liquid masses, however, still showing some white streaks. These streaks disappeared after an additional period of 6 hrs. 30 m.; and by next morning (i.e. 48 hrs. from the time when the cubes were first placed on the glands) the liquefied matter was wholly absorbed. A cube of albumen was left on another tall gland, which first absorbed the secretion and after 24 hrs. poured forth a fresh supply. This cube, now surrounded by secretion, was left on the gland for an additional 24 hrs., but was very little, if at all, acted on. We may, therefore, conclude, either that the secretion from the tall glands has little power of digestion, though strongly acid, or that the amount poured forth from a single gland is insufficient to dissolve a particle of albumen which within the same time would have been dissolved by the secretion from several of the small sessile glands. Owing to the death of my last plant, I was unable to ascertain which of these alternatives is the true one. Four minute shreds of pure fibrin were placed, each resting on one, two, or three of the taller glands. In the course of 2 hrs. 30 m. the secretion was all absorbed, and the shreds were left almost dry. They [page 341] were then pushed on to the sessile glands. One shred, after 2 hrs. 30 m., seemed quite dissolved, but this may have been a mistake. A second, when examined after 17 hrs. 25 m., was liquefied, but the liquid as seen under the microscope still contained floating granules of fibrin. The other two shreds were completely liquefied after 21 hrs. 30 m.; but in one of the drops a very few granules could still be detected. These, however, were dissolved after an additional interval of 6 hrs. 30 m.; and the surface of the leaf for some distance all round was covered with limpid fluid. It thus appears that Drosophyllum digests albumen and fibrin rather more quickly than Drosera can; and this may perhaps be attributed to the acid, together probably with some small amount of the ferment, being present in the secretion, before the glands have been stimulated; so that digestion begins at once. Concluding Remarks.—The linear leaves of Drosophyllum differ but slightly from those of certain species of Drosera; the chief differences being, firstly, the presence of minute, almost sessile, glands, which, like those of Dionaea, do not secrete until they are excited by the absorption of nitrogenous matter. But glands of this kind are present on the leaves of Drosera binata, and appear to be represented by the papillae on the leaves of Drosera rotundifolia. Secondly, the presence of tentacles on the backs of the leaves; but we have seen that a few tentacles, irregularly placed and tending towards abortion, are retained on the backs of the leaves of Drosera binata. There are greater differences in function between the two genera. The most important one is that the tentacles of Drosophyllum have no power of movement; this loss being partially replaced by the drops of viscid [page 342] secretion being readily withdrawn from the glands; so that, when an insect comes into contact with a drop, it is able to crawl away, but soon touches other drops, and then, smothered by the secretion, sinks down on the sessile glands and dies. Another difference is, that the secretion from the tall glands, before they have been in any way excited, is strongly acid, and perhaps contains a small quantity of the proper ferment. Again, these glands do not secrete more copiously from being excited by the absorption of nitrogenous matter; on the contrary, they then absorb their own secretion with extraordinary quickness. In a short time they begin to secrete again. All these circumstances are probably connected with the fact that insects do not commonly adhere to the glands with which they first come into contact, though this does sometimes occur; and that it is chiefly the secretion from the sessile glands which dissolves animal matter out of their bodies. RORIDULA. Roridula dentata.—This plant, a native of the western parts of the Cape of Good Hope, was sent to me in a dried state from Kew. It has an almost woody stem and branches, and apparently grows to a height of some feet. The leaves are linear, with their summits much attenuated. Their upper and lower surfaces are concave, with a ridge in the middle, and both are covered with tentacles, which differ greatly in length; some being very long, especially those on the tips of the leaves, and some very short. The glands also differ much in size and are somewhat elongated. They are supported on multicellular pedicels. This plant, therefore, agrees in several respects with [page 343] Drosophyllum, but differs in the following points. I could detect no sessile glands; nor would these have been of any use, as the upper surface of the leaves is thickly clothed with pointed, unicellular hairs directed upwards. The pedicels of the tentacles do not include spiral vessels; nor are there any spiral cells within the glands. The leaves often arise in tufts and are pinnatifid, the divisions projecting at right angles to the main linear blade. These lateral divisions are often very short and bear only a single terminal tentacle, with one or two short ones on the sides. No distinct line of demarcation can be drawn between the pedicels of the long terminal tentacles and the much attenuated summits of the leaves. We may, indeed, arbitrarily fix on the point to which the spiral vessels proceeding from the blade extend; but there is no other distinction. It was evident from the many particles of dirt sticking to the glands that they secrete much viscid matter. A large number of insects of many kinds also adhered to the leaves. I could nowhere discover any signs of the tentacles having been inflected over the captured insects; and this probably would have been seen even in the dried specimens, had they possessed the power of movement. Hence, in this negative character, Roridula resembles its northern representative, Drosophyllum. BYBLIS. Byblis gigantea (Western Australia).—A dried specimen, about 18 inches in height, with a strong stem, was sent me from Kew. The leaves are some inches in length, linear, slightly flattened, with a small projecting rib on the lower surface. They are covered on all sides by glands of two kinds [page 344] —sessile ones arranged in rows, and others supported on moderately long pedicels. Towards the narrow summits of the leaves the pedicels are longer than elsewhere, and here equal the diameter of the leaf. The glands are purplish, much flattened, and formed of a single layer of radiating cells, which in the larger glands are from forty to fifty in number. The pedicels consist of single elongated cells, with colourless, extremely delicate walls, marked with the finest intersecting spiral lines. Whether these lines are the result of contraction from the drying of the walls, I do not know, but the whole pedicel was often spirally rolled up. These glandular hairs are far more simple in structure than the so-called tentacles of the preceding genera, and they do not differ essentially from those borne by innumerable other plants. The flower-peduncles bear similar glands. The most singular character about the leaves is that the apex is enlarged into a little knob, covered with glands, and about a third broader than the adjoining part of the attenuated leaf. In two places dead flies adhered to the glands. As no instance is known of unicellular structures having any power of movement,* Byblis, no doubt, catches insects solely by the aid of its viscid secretion. These probably sink down besmeared with the secretion and rest on the small sessile glands, which, if we may judge by the analogy of Drosophyllum, then pour forth their secretion and afterwards absorb the digested matter. Supplementary Observations on the Power of Absorption by the Glandular Hairs of other Plants.—A few observations on this subject may be here conveniently introduced. As the glands of many, probably of all, * Sachs, ‘Traité de Bot.,’ 3rd edit. 1874, p. 1026. [page 345] the species of Droseraceae absorb fluids or at least allow them readily to enter,* it seemed desirable to ascertain how far the glands of other plants which are not specially adapted for capturing insects, had the same power. Plants were chosen for trial at hazard, with the exception of two species of saxifrage, which were selected from belonging to a family allied to the Droseraceae. Most of the experiments were made by immersing the glands either in an infusion of raw meat or more commonly in a solution of carbonate of ammonia, as this latter substance acts so powerfully and rapidly on protoplasm. It seemed also particularly desirable to ascertain whether ammonia was absorbed, as a small amount is contained in rain-water. With the Droseraceae the secretion of a viscid fluid by the glands does not prevent their absorbing; so that the glands of other plants might excrete superfluous matter, or secrete an odoriferous fluid as a protection against the attacks of insects, or for any other purpose, and yet have the power of absorbing. I regret that in the following cases I did not try whether the secretion could digest or render soluble animal substances, but such experiments would have been difficult on account of the small size of the glands and the small amount of secretion. We shall see in the next chapter that the secretion from the glandular hairs of Pinguicula certainly dissolves animal matter. [Saxifraga umbrosa.—The flower-peduncles and petioles of the leaves are clothed with short hairs, bearing pink-coloured glands, formed of several polygonal cells, with their pedicels divided by partitions into distinct cells, which are generally colourless, but sometimes pink. The glands secrete a yellowish viscid fluid, by * The distinction between true absorption and mere permeation, or imbibition, is by no means clearly understood: see Müller’s ‘Physiology,’ Eng. translat. 1838, vol. i. p. 280. [page 346] which minute Diptera are sometimes, though not often, caught.* The cells of the glands contain bright pink fluid, charged with granules or with globular masses of pinkish pulpy matter. This matter must be protoplasm, for it is seen to undergo slow but incessant changes of form if a gland be placed in a drop of water and examined. Similar movements were observed after glands had been immersed in water for 1, 3, 5, 18, and 27 hrs. Even after this latter period the glands retained their bright pink colour; and the protoplasm within their cells did not appear to have become more aggregated. The continually changing forms of the little masses of protoplasm are not due to the absorption of water, as they were seen in glands kept dry. A flower-stem, still attached to a plant, was bent (May 29) so as to remain immersed for 23 hrs. 30 m. in a strong infusion of raw meat. The colour of the contents of the glands was slightly changed, being now of a duller and more purple tint than before. The contents also appeared more aggregated, for the spaces between the little masses of protoplasm were wider; but this latter result did not follow in some other and similar experiments. The masses seemed to change their forms more rapidly than did those in water; so that the cells had a different appearance every four or five minutes. Elongated masses became in the course of one or two minutes spherical; and spherical ones drew themselves out and united with others. Minute masses rapidly increased in size, and three distinct ones were seen to unite. The movements were, in short, exactly like those described in the case of Drosera. The cells of the pedicels were not affected by the infusion; nor were they in the following experiment. Another flower-stem was placed in the same manner and for the same length of time in a solution of one part of nitrate of ammonia to 146 of water (or 3 grs. to 1 oz.), and the glands were discoloured in exactly the same manner as by the infusion of raw meat. Another flower-stem was immersed, as before, in a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 109 of water. The glands, after 1 hr. 30 m., were not discoloured, but after 3 hrs. 45 m. most of them had become dull purple, some of them blackish- * In the case of Saxifraga tridactylites, Mr. Druce says (‘Pharmaceutical Journal,’ May 1875) that he examined some dozens of plants, and in almost every instance remnants of insects adhered to the leaves. So it is, as I hear from a friend, with this plant in Ireland. [page 347] green, a few being still unaffected. The little masses of protoplasm within the cells were seen in movement. The cells of the pedicels were unaltered. The experiment was repeated, and a fresh flower-stem was left for 23 hrs. in the solution, and now a great effect was produced; all the glands were much blackened, and the previously transparent fluid in the cells of the pedicels, even down to their bases, contained spherical masses of granular matter. By comparing many different hairs, it was evident that the glands first absorb the carbonate, and that the effect thus produced travels down the hairs from cell to cell. The first change which could be observed is a cloudy appearance in the fluid, due to the formation of very fine granules, which afterwards aggregate into larger masses. Altogether, in the darkening of the glands, and in the process of aggregation travelling down the cells of the pedicels, there is the closest resemblance to what takes place when a tentacle of Drosera is immersed in a weak solution of the same salt. The glands, however, absorb very much more slowly than those of Drosera. Besides the glandular hairs, there are star-shaped organs which do not appear to secrete, and which were not in the least affected by the above solutions. Although in the case of uninjured flower-stems and leaves the carbonate seems to be absorbed only by the glands, yet it enters a cut surface much more quickly than a gland. Strips of the rind of a flower-stem were torn off, and the cells of the pedicels were seen to contain only colourless transparent fluid; those of the glands including as usual some granular matter. These strips were then immersed in the same solution as before (one part of the carbonate to 109 of water), and in a few minutes granular matter appeared in the lowercells of all the pedicels. The action invariably commenced (for I tried the experiment repeatedly) in the lowest cells, and therefore close to the torn surface, and then gradually travelled up the hairs until it reached the glands, in a reversed direction to what occurs in uninjured specimens. The glands then became discoloured, and the previously contained granular matter was aggregated into larger masses. Two short bits of a flower-stem were also left for 2 hrs. 40 m. in a weaker solution of one part of the carbonate to 218 of water; and in both specimens the pedicels of the hairs near the cut ends now contained much granular matter; and the glands were completely discoloured. Lastly, bits of meat were placed on some glands; these were examined after 23 hrs., as were others, which had apparently not long before caught minute flies; but they did not present any [page 348] difference from the glands of other hairs. Perhaps there may not have been time enough for absorption. I think so as some glands, on which dead flies had evidently long lain, were of a pale dirty purple colour or even almost colourless, and the granular matter within them presented an unusual and somewhat peculiar appearance. That these glands had absorbed animal matter from the flies, probably by exosmose into the viscid secretion, we may infer, not only from their changed colour, but because, when placed in a solution of carbonate of ammonia, some of the cells in their pedicels become filled with granular matter; whereas the cells of other hairs, which had not caught flies, after being treated with the same solution for the same length of time, contained only a small quantity of granular matter. But more evidence is necessary before we fully admit that the glands of this saxifrage can absorb, even with ample time allowed, animal matter from the minute insects which they occasionally and accidentally capture. Saxifraga rotundifolia (?).—The hairs on the flower-stems of this species are longer than those just described, and bear pale brown glands. Many were examined, and the cells of the pedicels were quite transparent. A bent stem was immersed for 30 m. in a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 109 of water, and two or three of the uppermost cells in the pedicels now contained granular or aggregated matter; the glands having become of a bright yellowish-green. The glands of this species therefore absorb the carbonate much more quickly than do those of Saxifraga umbrosa, and the upper cells of the pedicels are likewise affected much more quickly. Pieces of the stem were cut off and immersed in the same solution; and now the process of aggregation travelled up the hairs in a reversed direction; the cells close to the cut surfaces being first affected. Primula sinensis.—The flower-stems, the upper and lower surfaces of the leaves and their footstalks, are all clothed with a multitude of longer and shorter hairs. The pedicels of the longer hairs are divided by transverse partitions into eight or nine cells. The enlarged terminal cell is globular, forming a gland which secretes a variable amount of thick, slightly viscid, not acid, brownish-yellow matter. A piece of a young flower-stem was first immersed in distilled water for 2 hrs. 30 m., and the glandular hairs were not at all affected. Another piece, bearing twenty-five short and nine long hairs, was carefully examined. The glands of the latter contained no solid or semi-solid matter; and those of only two [page 349] of the twenty-five short hairs contained some globules. This piece was then immersed for 2 hrs. in a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 109 of water, and now the glands of the twenty-five shorter hairs, with two or three exceptions, contained either one large or from two to five smaller spherical masses of semi-solid matter. Three of the glands of the nine long hairs likewise included similar masses. In a few hairs there were also globules in the cells immediately beneath the glands. Looking to all thirty-four hairs, there could be no doubt that the glands had absorbed some of the carbonate. Another piece was left for only 1 hr. in the same solution, and aggregated matter appeared in all the glands. My son Francis examined some glands of the longer hairs, which contained little masses of matter, before they were immersed in any solution; and these masses slowly changed their forms, so that no doubt they consisted of protoplasm. He then irrigated these hairs for 1 hr. 15 m., whilst under the microscope, with a solution of one part of the carbonate to 218 of water; the glands were not perceptibly affected, nor could this have been expected, as their contents were already aggregated. But in the cells of the pedicels numerous, almost colourless, spheres of matter appeared, which changed their forms and slowly coalesced; the appearance of the cells being thus totally changed at successive intervals of time. The glands on a young flower-stem, after having been left for 2 hrs. 45 m. in a strong solution of one part of the carbonate to 109 of water, contained an abundance of aggregated masses, but whether generated by the action of the salt, I do not know. This piece was again placed in the solution, so that it was immersed altogether for 6 hrs. 15 m., and now there was a great change; for almost all the spherical masses within the gland-cells had disappeared, being replaced by granular matter of a darker brown. The experiment was thrice repeated with nearly the same result. On one occasion the piece was left immersed for 8 hrs. 30 m., and though almost all the spherical masses were changed into the brown granular matter, a few still remained. If the spherical masses of aggregated matter had been originally produced merely by some chemical or physical action, it seems strange that a somewhat longer immersion in the same solution should so completely alter their character. But as the masses which slowly and spontaneously changed their forms must have consisted of living protoplasm, there is nothing surprising in its being injured or killed, and its appearance wholly changed by long immersion in so strong a solution of the carbonate as that [page 350] employed. A solution of this strength paralyses all movement in Drosera, but does not kill the protoplasm; a still stronger solution prevents the protoplasm from aggregating into the ordinary full-sized globular masses, and these, though they do not disintegrate, become granular and opaque. In nearly the same manner, too hot water and certain solutions (for instance, of the salts of soda and potash) cause at first an imperfect kind of aggregation in the cells of Drosera; the little masses afterwards breaking up into granular or pulpy brown matter. All the foregoing experiments were made on flower-stems, but a piece of a leaf was immersed for 30 m. in a strong solution of the carbonate (one part to 109 of water), and little globular masses of matter appeared in all the glands, which before contained only limpid fluid. I made also several experiments on the action of the vapour of the carbonate on the glands; but will give only a few cases. The cut end of the footstalk of a young leaf was protected with sealing-wax, and was then placed under a small bell-glass, with a large pinch of the carbonate. After 10 m. the glands showed a considerable degree of aggregation, and the protoplasm lining the cells of the pedicels was a little separated from the walls. Another leaf was left for 50 m. with the same result, excepting that the hairs became throughout their whole length of a brownish colour. In a third leaf, which was exposed for 1 hr. 50 m., there was much aggregated matter in the glands; and some of the masses showed signs of breaking up into brown granular matter. This leaf was again placed in the vapour, so that it was exposed altogether for 5 hrs. 30 m.; and now, though I examined a large number of glands, aggregated masses were found in only two or three; in all the others, the masses, which before had been globular, were converted into brown, opaque, granular matter. We thus see that exposure to the vapour for a considerable time produces the same effects as long immersion in a strong solution. In both cases there could hardly be a doubt that the salt had been absorbed chiefly or exclusively by the glands. On another occasion bits of damp fibrin, drops of a weak infusion of raw meat and of water, were left for 24 hrs. on some leaves; the hairs were then examined, but to my surprise differed in no respect from others which had not been touched by these fluids. Most of the cells, however, included hyaline, motionless little spheres, which did not seem to consist of protoplasm, but, I suppose, of some balsam or essential oil. Pelargonium zonale (var. edged with white).—The leaves [page 351] are clothed with numerous multicellular hairs; some simply pointed; others bearing glandular heads, and differing much in length. The glands on a piece of leaf were examined and found to contain only limpid fluid; most of the water was removed from beneath the covering glass, and a minute drop of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 146 of water was added; so that an extremely small dose was given. After an interval of only 3 m. there were signs of aggregation within the glands of the shorter hairs; and after 5 m. many small globules of a pale brown tint appeared in all of them; similar globules, but larger, being found in the large glands of the longer hairs. After the specimen had been left for 1 hr. in the solution, many of the smaller globules had changed their positions; and two or three vacuoles or small spheres (for I know not which they were) of a rather darker tint appeared within some of the larger globules. Little globules could now be seen in some of the uppermost cells of the pedicels, and the protoplasmic lining was slightly separated from the walls of the lower cells. After 2 hrs. 30 m. from the time of first immersion, the large globules within the glands of the longer hairs were converted into masses of darker brown granular matter. Hence from what we have seen with Primula sinensis, there can be little doubt that these masses originally consisted of living protoplasm. A drop of a weak infusion of raw meat was placed on a leaf, and after 2 hrs. 30 m. many spheres could be seen within the glands. These spheres, when looked at again after 30 m., had slightly changed their positions and forms, and one had separated into two; but the changes were not quite like those which the protoplasm of Drosera undergoes. These hairs, moreover, had not been examined before immersion, and there were similar spheres in some glands which had not been touched by the infusion. Erica tetralix.—A few long glandular hairs project from the margins of the upper surfaces of the leaves. The pedicels are formed of several rows of cells, and support rather large globular heads, secreting viscid matter, by which minute insects are occasionally, though rarely, caught. Some leaves were left for 23 hrs. in a weak infusion of raw meat and in water, and the hairs were then compared, but they differed very little or not at all. In both cases the contents of the cells seemed rather more granular than they were before; but the granules did not exhibit any movement. Other leaves were left for 23 hrs. in a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 218 of water, and here again the granular matter appeared to have increased [page 352] in amount; but one such mass retained exactly the same form as before after an interval of 5 hrs., so that it could hardly have consisted of living protoplasm. These glands seem to have very little or no power of absorption, certainly much less than those of the foregoing plants. Mirabilis longiflora.—The stems and both surfaces of the leaves bear viscid hairs. young plants, from 12 to 18 inches in height in my greenhouse, caught so many minute Diptera, Coleoptera, and larvæ, that they were quite dusted with them. The hairs are short, of unequal lengths, formed of a single row of cells, surmounted by an enlarged cell which secretes viscid matter. These terminal cells or glands contain granules and often globules of granular matter. Within a gland which had caught a small insect, one such mass was observed to undergo incessant changes of form, with the occasional appearance of vacuoles. But I do not believe that this protoplasm had been generated by matter absorbed from the dead insect; for, on comparing several glands which had and had not caught insects, not a shade of difference could be perceived between them, and they all contained fine granular matter. A piece of leaf was immersed for 24 hrs. in a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 218 of water, but the hairs seemed very little affected by it, excepting that perhaps the glands were rendered rather more opaque. In the leaf itself, however, the grains of chlorophyll near the cut surfaces had run together, or become aggregated. Nor were the glands on another leaf, after an immersion for 24 hrs. in an infusion of raw meat, in the least affected; but the protoplasm lining the cells of the pedicels had shrunk greatly from the walls. This latter effect may have been due to exosmose, as the infusion was strong. We may, therefore, conclude that the glands of this plant either have no power of absorption or that the protoplasm which they contain is not acted on by a solution of carbonate of ammonia (and this seems scarcely credible) or by an infusion of meat. Nicotiana tabacum.—This plant is covered with innumerable hairs of unequal lengths, which catch many minute insects. The pedicels of the hairs are divided by transverse partitions, and the secreting glands are formed of many cells, containing greenish matter with little globules of some substance. Leaves were left in an infusion of raw meat and in water for 26 hrs., but presented no difference. Some of these same leaves were then left for above 2 hrs. in a solution of carbonate of ammonia, but no effect was produced. I regret that other experiments were not tried with more care, as M. Schloesing [page 353] has shown* that tobacco plants supplied with the vapour of carbonate of ammonia yield on analysis a greater amount of nitrogen than other plants not thus treated; and, from what we have seen, it is probable that some of the vapour may be absorbed by the glandular hairs.] A Summary of the Observations on Glandular Hairs.—From the foregoing observations, few as they are, we see that the glands of two species of Saxifraga, of a Primula and Pelargonium, have the power of rapid absorption; whereas the glands of an Erica, Mirabilis, and Nicotiana, either have no such power, or the contents of the cells are not affected by the fluids employed, namely a solution of carbonate of ammonia and an infusion of raw meat. As the glands of the Mirabilis contain protoplasm, which did not become aggregated from exposure to the fluids just named, though the contents of the cells in the blade of the leaf were greatly affected by carbonate of ammonia, we may infer that they cannot absorb. We may further infer that the innumerable insects caught by this plant are of no more service to it than are those which adhere to the deciduous and sticky scales of the leaf-buds of the horse-chestnut. The most interesting case for us is that of the two species of Saxifraga, as this genus is distantly allied to Drosera. Their glands absorb matter from an infusion of raw meat, from solutions of the nitrate and carbonate of ammonia, and apparently from decayed insects. This was shown by the changed dull purple colour of the protoplasm within the cells of the glands, by its state of aggregation, and apparently by its more rapid spontaneous movements. * ‘Comptes rendus,’ June 15, 1874. A good abstract of this paper is given in the ‘Gardener’s Chronicle,’ July 11, 1874. [page 354] The aggregating process spreads from the glands down the pedicels of the hairs; and we may assume that any matter which is absorbed ultimately reaches the tissues of the plant. On the other hand, the process travels up the hairs whenever a surface is cut and exposed to a solution of the carbonate of ammonia. The glands on the flower-stalks and leaves of Primula sinensis quickly absorb a solution of the carbonate of ammonia, and the protoplasm which they contain becomes aggregated. The process was seen in some cases to travel from the glands into the upper cells of the pedicels. Exposure for 10 m. to the vapour of this salt likewise induced aggregation. When leaves were left from 6 hrs. to 7 hrs. in a strong solution, or were long exposed to the vapour, the little masses of protoplasm became disintegrated, brown, and granular, and were apparently killed. An infusion of raw meat produced no effect on the glands. The limpid contents of the glands of Pelargonium zonale became cloudy and granular in from 3 m. to 5 m. when they were immersed in a weak solution of the carbonate of ammonia; and in the course of 1 hr. granules appeared in the upper cells of the pedicels. As the aggregated masses slowly changed their forms, and as they suffered disintegration when left for a considerable time in a strong solution, there can be little doubt that they consisted of protoplasm. It is doubtful whether an infusion of raw meat produced any effect. The glandular hairs of ordinary plants have generally been considered by physiologists to serve only as secreting or excreting organs, but we now know that they have the power, at least in some cases, of absorbing both a solution and the vapour of ammonia. As rain-water contains a small percentage of ammonia, and the atmosphere a minute quantity of the carbonate, this [page 355] power can hardly fail to be beneficial. Nor can the benefit be quite so insignificant as it might at first be thought, for a moderately fine plant of Primula sinensis bears the astonishing number of above two millions and a half of glandular hairs,* all of which are able to absorb ammonia brought to them by the rain. It is moreover probable that the glands of some of the above named plants obtain animal matter from the insects which are occasionally entangled by the viscid secretion. CONCLUDING REMARKS ON THE DROSERACEÆ. The six known genera composing this family have now been described in relation to our present subject, as far as my means have permitted. They all capture insects. This is effected by Drosophyllum, Roridula, and Byblis, solely by the viscid fluid secreted from their glands; by Drosera, through the same means, together with the movements of the tentacles; by Dionaea and Aldrovanda, through the closing of the blades of the leaf. In these two last genera rapid * My son Francis counted the hairs on a space measured by means of a micrometer, and found that there were 35,336 on a square inch of the upper surface of a leaf, and 30,035 on the lower surface; that is, in about the proportion of 100 on the upper to 85 on the lower surface. On a square inch of both surfaces there were 65,371 hairs. A moderately fine plant bearing twelve leaves (the larger ones being a little more than 2 inches in diameter) was now selected, and the area of all the leaves, together with their foot-stalks (the flower-stems not being included), was found by a planimeter to be 39.285 square inches; so that the area of both surfaces was 78.57 square inches. Thus the plant (excluding the flower-stems) must have borne the astonishing number of 2,568,099 glandular hairs. The hairs were counted late in the autumn, and by the following spring (May) the leaves of some other plants of the same lot were found to be from one-third to one-fourth broader and longer than they were before; so that no doubt the glandular hairs had increased in number, and probably now much exceeded three millions. [page 356] movement makes up for the loss of viscid secretion. In every case it is some part of the leaf which moves. In Aldrovanda it appears to be the basal parts alone which contract and carry with them the broad, thin margins of the lobes. In Dionaea the whole lobe, with the exception of the marginal prolongations or spikes, curves inwards, though the chief seat of movement is near the midrib. In Drosera the chief seat is in the lower part of the tentacles, which, homologically, may be considered as prolongations of the leaf; but the whole blade often curls inwards, converting the leaf into a temporary stomach. There can hardly be a doubt that all the plants belonging to these six genera have the power of dissolving animal matter by the aid of their secretion, which contains an acid, together with a ferment almost identical in nature with pepsin; and that they afterwards absorb the matter thus digested. This is certainly the case with Drosera, Drosophyllum, and Dionaea; almost certainly with Aldrovanda; and, from analogy, very probable with Roridula and Byblis. We can thus understand how it is that the three first-named genera are provided with such small roots, and that Aldrovanda is quite rootless; about the roots of the two other genera nothing is known. It is, no doubt, a surprising fact that a whole group of plants (and, as we shall presently see, some other plants not allied to the Droseraceae) should subsist partly by digesting animal matter, and partly by decomposing carbonic acid, instead of exclusively by this latter means, together with the absorption of matter from the soil by the aid of roots. We have, however, an equally anomalous case in the animal kingdom; the rhizocephalous crustaceans do not feed like other animals by their mouths, for they are destitute of an [page 357] alimentary canal; but they live by absorbing through root-like processes the juices of the animals on which they are parasitic.* Of the six genera, Drosera has been incomparably the most successful in the battle for life; and a large part of its success may be attributed to its manner of catching insects. It is a dominant form, for it is believed to include about 100 species,** which range in the Old World from the Arctic regions to Southern India, to the Cape of Good Hope, Madagascar, and Australia; and in the New World from Canada to Tierra del Fuego. In this respect it presents a marked contrast with the five other genera, which appear to be failing groups. Dionaea includes only a single species, which is confined to one district in Carolina. The three varieties or closely allied species of Aldrovanda, like so many water-plants, have a wide range from Central Europe to Bengal and Australia. Drosophyllum includes only one species, limited to Portugal and Morocco. Roridula and Byblis each have (as I * Fritz Müller, ‘Facts for Darwin,’ Eng. trans. 1869, p. 139. The rhizocephalous crustaceans are allied to the cirripedes. It is hardly possible to imagine a greater difference than that between an animal with prehensile limbs, a well-constructed mouth and alimentary canal, and one destitute of all these organs and feeding by absorption through branching root-like processes. If one rare cirripede, the Anelasma squalicola, had become extinct, it would have been very difficult to conjecture how so enormous a change could have been gradually effected. But, as Fritz Müller remarks, we have in Anelasma an animal in an almost exactly intermediate condition, for it has root-like processes embedded in the skin of the shark on which it is parasitic, and its prehensile cirri and mouth (as described in my monograph on the Lepadidae, ‘Ray Soc.’ 1851, p. 169) are in a most feeble and almost rudimentary condition. Dr. R. Kossmann has given a very interesting discussion on this subject in his ‘Suctoria and Lepadidae,’ 1873. See also, Dr. Dohrn, ‘Der Ursprung der Wirbelthiere,’ 1875, p. 77. ** Bentham and Hooker, ‘Genera Plantarum.’ Australia is the metropolis of the genus, forty-one species having been described from this country, as Prof. Oliver informs me. [page 358] hear from Prof. Oliver) two species; the former confined to the western parts of the Cape of Good Hope, and the latter to Australia. It is a strange fact that Dionaea, which is one of the most beautifully adapted plants in the vegetable kingdom, should apparently be on the high-road to extinction. This is all the more strange as the organs of Dionaea are more highly differentiated than those of Drosera; its filaments serve exclusively as organs of touch, the lobes for capturing insects, and the glands, when excited, for secretion as well as for absorption; whereas with Drosera the glands serve all these purposes, and secrete without being excited. By comparing the structure of the leaves, their degree of complication, and their rudimentary parts in the six genera, we are led to infer that their common parent form partook of the characters of Drosophyllum, Roridula, and Byblis. The leaves of this ancient form were almost certainly linear, perhaps divided, and bore on their upper and lower surfaces glands which had the power of secreting and absorbing. Some of these glands were mounted on pedicels, and others were almost sessile; the latter secreting only when stimulated by the absorption of nitrogenous matter. In Byblis the glands consist of a single layer of cells, supported on a unicellular pedicel; in Roridula they have a more complex structure, and are supported on pedicels formed of several rows of cells; in Drosophyllum they further include spiral cells, and the pedicels include a bundle of spiral vessels. But in these three genera these organs do not possess any power of movement, and there is no reason to doubt that they are of the nature of hairs or trichomes. Although in innumerable instances foliar organs move when excited, no case is known of a trichome having such [page 359] power.* We are thus led to inquire how the so-called tentacles of Drosera, which are manifestly of the same general nature as the glandular hairs of the above three genera, could have acquired the power of moving. Many botanists maintain that these tentacles consist of prolongations of the leaf, because they include vascular tissue, but this can no longer be considered as a trustworthy distinction.** The possession of the power of movement on excitement would have been safer evidence. But when we consider the vast number of the tentacles on both surfaces of the leaves of Drosophyllum, and on the upper surface of the leaves of Drosera, it seems scarcely possible that each tentacle could have aboriginally existed as a prolongation of the leaf. Roridula, perhaps, shows us how we may reconcile these difficulties with respect to the homological nature of the tentacles. The lateral divisions of the leaves of this plant terminate in long tentacles; and these include spiral vessels which extend for only a short distance up them, with no line of demarcation between what is plainly the prolongation of the leaf and the pedicel of a glandular hair. Therefore there would be nothing anomalous or unusual in the basal parts of these tentacles, which correspond with the marginal ones of Drosera, acquiring the power of movement; and we know that in Drosera it is only the lower part which becomes inflected. But in order to understand how in this latter genus not only the marginal but all the inner tentacles have become capable of movement, we must further assume, either that through the principle of correlated development this * Sachs, ‘Traité de Botanique’ 3rd edit. 1874, p. 1026. ** Dr. Warming ‘Sur la Diffrence entres les Trichomes,’ Copenhague, 1873, p. 6. ‘Extrait des Videnskabelige Meddelelser de la Soc. d’Hist. nat. de Copenhague,’ Nos. 10-12, 1872. [page 360] power was transferred to the basal parts of the hairs, or that the surface of the leaf has been prolonged upwards at numerous points, so as to unite with the hairs, thus forming the bases of the inner tentacles. The above named three genera, namely Drosophyllum, Roridula, and Byblis, which appear to have retained a primordial condition, still bear glandular hairs on both surfaces of their leaves; but those on the lower surface have since disappeared in the more highly developed genera, with the partial exception of one species, Drosera binata. The small sessile glands have also disappeared in some of the genera, being replaced in Roridula by hairs, and in most species of Drosera by absorbent papillae. Drosera binata, with its linear and bifurcating leaves, is in an intermediate condition. It still bears some sessile glands on both surfaces of the leaves, and on the lower surface a few irregularly placed tentacles, which are incapable of movement. A further slight change would convert the linear leaves of this latter species into the oblong leaves of Drosera anglica, and these might easily pass into orbicular ones with footstalks, like those of Drosera rotundifolia. The footstalks of this latter species bear multicellular hairs, which we have good reason to believe represent aborted tentacles. The parent form of Dionaea and Aldrovanda seems to have been closely allied to Drosera, and to have had rounded leaves, supported on distinct footstalks, and furnished with tentacles all round the circumference, with other tentacles and sessile glands on the upper surface. I think so because the marginal spikes of Dionaea apparently represent the extreme marginal tentacles of Drosera, the six (sometimes eight) sensitive filaments on the upper surface, as well as the more numerous ones in Aldrovanda, representing the central [page 361] tentacles of Drosera, with their glands aborted, but their sensitiveness retained. Under this point of view we should bear in mind that the summits of the tentacles of Drosera, close beneath the glands, are sensitive. The three most remarkable characters possessed by the several members of the Droseraceae consist in the leaves of some having the power of movement when excited, in their glands secreting a fluid which digests animal matter, and in their absorption of the digested matter. Can any light be thrown on the steps by which these remarkable powers were gradually acquired? As the walls of the cells are necessarily permeable to fluids, in order to allow the glands to secrete, it is not surprising that they should readily allow fluids to pass inwards; and this inward passage would deserve to be called an act of absorption, if the fluids combined with the contents of the glands. Judging from the evidence above given, the secreting glands of many other plants can absorb salts of ammonia, of which they must receive small quantities from the rain. This is the case with two species of Saxifraga, and the glands of one of them apparently absorb matter from captured insects, and certainly from an infusion of raw meat. There is, therefore, nothing anomalous in the Droseraceae having acquired the power of absorption in a much more highly developed degree. It is a far more remarkable problem how the members of this family, and Pinguicula, and, as Dr. Hooker has recently shown, Nepenthes, could all have acquired the power of secreting a fluid which dissolves or digests animal matter. The six genera of the Droseraceae very probably inherited this power from a common progenitor, but this cannot apply to [page 362] Pinguicula or Nepenthes, for these plants are not at all closely related to the Droceraceae. But the difficulty is not nearly so great as it at first appears. Firstly, the juices of many plants contain an acid, and, apparently, any acid serves for digestion. Secondly, as Dr. Hooker has remarked in relation to the present subject in his address at Belfast (1874), and as Sachs repeatedly insists,* the embryos of some plants secrete a fluid which dissolves albuminous substances out of the endosperm; although the endosperm is not actually united with, only in contact with, the embryo. All plants, moreover, have the power of dissolving albuminous or proteid substances, such as protoplasm, chlorophyll, gluten, aleurone, and of carrying them from one part to other parts of their tissues. This must be effected by a solvent, probably consisting of a ferment together with an acid.** Now, in the case of plants which are able to absorb already soluble matter from captured insects, though not capable of true digestion, the solvent just referred to, which must be occasionally present in the glands, would be apt to exude from the glands together with the viscid secretion, inasmuch as endosmose is accompanied by exosmose. If such exudation did ever occur, the solvent would act on the animal matter contained within the captured insects, and this would be an act of true digestion. As it cannot be doubted that this process would be of high service to plants * ‘Traité de Botanique’ 3rd edit. 1874, p. 844. See also for following facts pp. 64, 76, 828, 831. ** Since this sentence was written, I have received a paper by Gorup-Besanez (‘Berichte der Deutschen Chem. Gesellschaft,’ Berlin, 1874, p. 1478), who, with the aid of Dr. H. Will, has actually made the discovery that the seeds of the vetch contain a ferment, which, when extracted by glycerine, dissolves albuminous substances, such as fibrin, and converts them into true peptones. [page 363] growing in very poor soil, it would tend to be perfected through natural selection. Therefore, any ordinary plant having viscid glands, which occasionally caught insects, might thus be converted under favourable circumstances into a species capable of true digestion. It ceases, therefore, to be any great mystery how several genera of plants, in no way closely related together, have independently acquired this same power. As there exist several plants the glands of which cannot, as far as is known, digest animal matter, yet can absorb salts of ammonia and animal fluids, it is probable that this latter power forms the first stage towards that of digestion. It might, however, happen, under certain conditions, that a plant, after having acquired the power of digestion, should degenerate into one capable only of absorbing animal matter in solution, or in a state of decay, or the final products of decay, namely the salts of ammonia. It would appear that this has actually occurred to a partial extent with the leaves of Aldrovanda; the outer parts of which possess absorbent organs, but no glands fitted for the secretion of any digestive fluid, these being confined to the inner parts. Little light can be thrown on the gradual acquirement of the third remarkable character possessed by the more highly developed genera of the Droseraceae, namely the power of movement when excited. It should, however, be borne in mind that leaves and their homologues, as well as flower-peduncles, have gained this power, in innumerable instances, independently of inheritance from any common parent form; for instance, in tendril-bearers and leaf-climbers (i.e. plants with their leaves, petioles and flower-peduncles, &c., modified for prehension) belonging to a large [page 364] number of the most widely distinct orders,—in the leaves of the many plants which go to sleep at night, or move when shaken,—and in the irritable stamens and pistils of not a few species. We may therefore infer that the power of movement can be by some means readily acquired. Such movements imply irritability or sensitiveness, but, as Cohn has remarked,* the tissues of the plants thus endowed do not differ in any uniform manner from those of ordinary plants; it is therefore probable that all leaves are to a slight degree irritable. Even if an insect alights on a leaf, a slight molecular change is probably transmitted to some distance across its tissue, with the sole difference that no perceptible effect is produced. We have some evidence in favour of this belief, for we know that a single touch on the glands of Drosera does not excite inflection; yet it must produce some effect, for if the glands have been immersed in a solution of camphor, inflection follows within a shorter time than would have followed from the effects of camphor alone. So again with Dionaea, the blades in their ordinary state may be roughly touched without their closing; yet some effect must be thus caused and transmitted across the whole leaf, for if the glands have recently absorbed animal matter, even a delicate touch causes them to close instantly. On the whole we may conclude that the acquirement of a high degree of sensitiveness and of the power of movement by certain genera of the Droseraceae presents no greater difficulty than that presented by the similar but feebler powers of a multitude of other plants. * See the abstract of his memoir on the contractile tissues of plants, in the ‘Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.’ 3rd series, vol. xi. p. 188.) [page 365] The specialised nature of the sensitiveness possessed by Drosera and Dionaea, and by certain other plants, well deserves attention. A gland of Drosera may be forcibly hit once, twice, or even thrice, without any effect being produced, whilst the continued pressure of an extremely minute particle excites movement. On the other hand, a particle many times heavier may be gently laid on one of the filaments of Dionaea with no effect; but if touched only once by the slow movement of a delicate hair, the lobes close; and this difference in the nature of the sensitiveness of these two plants stands in manifest adaptation to their manner of capturing insects. So does the fact, that when the central glands of Drosera absorb nitrogenous matter, they transmit a motor impulse to the exterior tentacles much more quickly than when they are mechanically irritated; whilst with Dionaea the absorption of nitrogenous matter causes the lobes to press together with extreme slowness, whilst a touch excites rapid movement. Somewhat analogous cases may be observed, as I have shown in another work, with the tendrils of various plants; some being most excited by contact with fine fibres, others by contact with bristles, others with a flat or a creviced surface. The sensitive organs of Drosera and Dionaea are also specialised, so as not to be uselessly affected by the weight or impact of drops of rain, or by blasts of air. This may be accounted for by supposing that these plants and their progenitors have grown accustomed to the repeated action of rain and wind, so that no molecular change is thus induced; whilst they have been rendered more sensitive by means of natural selection to the rarer impact or pressure of solid bodies. Although the absorption by the glands of Drosera of various fluids excites move- [page 366] ment, there is a great difference in the action of allied fluids; for instance, between certain vegetable acids, and between citrate and phosphate of ammonia. The specialised nature and perfection of the sensitiveness in these two plants is all the more astonishing as no one supposes that they possess nerves; and by testing Drosera with several substances which act powerfully on the nervous system of animals, it does not appear that they include any diffused matter analogous to nerve-tissue. Although the cells of Drosera and Dionaea are quite as sensitive to certain stimulants as are the tissues which surround the terminations of the nerves in the higher animals, yet these plants are inferior even to animals low down in the scale, in not being affected except by stimulants in contact with their sensitive parts. They would, however, probably be affected by radiant heat; for warm water excites energetic movement. When a gland of Drosera, or one of the filaments of Dionaea, is excited, the motor impulse radiates in all directions, and is not, as in the case of animals, directed towards special points or organs. This holds good even in the case of Drosera when some exciting substance has been placed at two points on the disc, and when the tentacles all round are inflected with marvellous precision towards the two points. The rate at which the motor impulse is transmitted, though rapid in Dionaea, is much slower than in most or all animals. This fact, as well as that of the motor impulse not being specially directed to certain points, are both no doubt due to the absence of nerves. Nevertheless we perhaps see the prefigurement of the formation of nerves in animals in the transmission of the motor impulse being so much more rapid down the confined space within the tentacles of Drosera than [page 367] elsewhere, and somewhat more rapid in a longitudinal than in a transverse direction across the disc. These plants exhibit still more plainly their inferiority to animals in the absence of any reflex action, except in so far as the glands of Drosera, when excited from a distance, send back some influence which causes the contents of the cells to become aggregated down to the bases of the tentacles. But the greatest inferiority of all is the absence of a central organ, able to receive impressions from all points, to transmit their effects in any definite direction, to store them up and reproduce them.

Pinguicula vulgaris—Structure of leaves—Number of insects and other objects caught— Movement of the margins of the leaves—Uses of this movement—Secretion, digestion, and absorption—Action of the secretion on various animal and vegetable substances—The effects of substances not containing soluble nitrogenous matter on the glands—Pinguicula grandiflora—Pinguicula lusitanica, catches insects—Movement of the leaves, secretion and digestion. Pinguicula vulgaris.—This plant grows in moist places, generally on mountains. It bears on an average eight, rather thick, oblong, light green leaves, having scarcely any footstalk. A full-sized leaf is about 1 1/2 inch in length and 3/4 inch in breadth. The young central leaves are deeply concave, and project upwards; the older ones towards the outside are flat or convex, and lie close to the ground, forming a rosette from 3 to 4 inches in diameter. The margins of the leaves are incurved. Their upper surfaces are thickly covered with two sets of glandular hairs, differing in the size of the glands and in the length of their pedicels. The larger glands have a circular outline as seen from above, and are of moderate thickness; they are divided by radiating partitions into sixteen cells, containing light-green, homogeneous fluid. They are supported on elongated, unicellular pedicels (containing a nucleus with a nucleolus) which rest on slight prominences. The small glands differ only in being formed of about half the number of cells, containing much paler fluid, and supported on much shorter pedicels. Near the midrib, towards the base of the leaf, the [page 369] pedicels are multicellular, are longer than elsewhere, and bear smaller glands. All the glands secrete a colourless fluid, which is so viscid that I have seen a fine thread drawn out to a length of 18 inches; but the fluid in this case was secreted by a gland which had been excited. The edge of the leaf is translucent, and does not bear any glands; and here the spiral vessels, proceeding from the midrib, terminate in cells marked by a spiral line, somewhat like those within the glands of Drosera. The roots are short. Three plants were dug up in North Wales on June 20, and carefully washed; each bore five or six unbranched roots, the longest of which was only 1.2 of an inch. Two rather young plants were examined on September 28; these had a greater number of roots, namely eight and eighteen, all under 1 inch in length, and very little branched. I was led to investigate the habits of this plant by being told by Mr. W. Marshall that on the mountains of Cumberland many insects adhere to the leaves. [A friend sent me on June 23 thirty-nine leaves from North Wales, which were selected owing to objects of some kind adhering to them. Of these leaves, thirty-two had caught 142 insects, or on an average 4.4 per leaf, minute fragments of insects not being included. Besides the insects, small leaves belonging to four different kinds of plants, those of Erica tetralix being much the commonest, and three minute seedling plants, blown by the wind, adhered to nineteen of the leaves. One had caught as many as ten leaves of the Erica. Seeds or fruits, commonly of Carex and one of Juncus, besides bits of moss and other rubbish, likewise adhered to six of the thirty-nine leaves. The same friend, on June 27, collected nine plants bearing seventy-four leaves, and all of these, with the exception of three young leaves, had caught insects; thirty insects were counted on one leaf, eighteen on a second, and sixteen on a third. Another friend examined on August 22 some plants in Donegal, Ireland, and found insects on 70 out of 157 leaves; fifteen of [page 370] these leaves were sent me, each having caught on an average 2.4 insects. To nine of them, leaves (mostly of Erica tetralix) adhered; but they had been specially selected on this latter account. I may add that early in August my son found leaves of this same Erica and the fruits of a Carex on the leaves of a Pinguicula in Switzerland, probably Pinguicula alpina; some insects, but no great number, also adhered to the leaves of this plant, which had much better developed roots than those of Pinguicula vulgaris. In Cumberland, Mr. Marshall, on September 3, carefully examined for me ten plants bearing eighty leaves; and on sixty-three of these (i.e. on 79 per cent.) he found insects, 143 in number; so that each leaf had on an average 2.27 insects. A few days later he sent me some plants with sixteen seeds or fruits adhering to fourteen leaves. There was a seed on three leaves on the same plant. The sixteen seeds belonged to nine different kinds, which could not be recognised, excepting one of Ranunculus, and several belonging to three or four distinct species of Carex. It appears that fewer insects are caught late in the year than earlier; thus in Cumberland from twenty to twenty-four insects were observed in the middle of July on several leaves, whereas in the beginning of September the average number was only 2.27. Most of the insects, in all the foregoing cases, were Diptera, but with many minute Hymenoptera, including some ants, a few small Coleoptera, larvæ, spiders, and even small moths.] We thus see that numerous insects and other objects are caught by the viscid leaves; but we have no right to infer from this fact that the habit is beneficial to the plant, any more than in the before given case of the Mirabilis, or of the horse-chestnut. But it will presently be seen that dead insects and other nitrogenous bodies excite the glands to increased secretion; and that the secretion then becomes acid and has the power of digesting animal substances, such as albumen, fibrin, &c. Moreover, the dissolved nitrogenous matter is absorbed by the glands, as shown by their limpid contents being aggregated into slowly moving granular masses of protoplasm. The same results follow when insects are naturally captured, and as the plant lives in poor soil and has small roots, there can be no [page 371] doubt that it profits by its power of digesting and absorbing matter from the prey which it habitually captures in such large numbers. It will, however, be convenient first to describe the movements of the leaves. Movements of the Leaves.—That such thick, large leaves as those of Pinguicula vulgarisshould have the power of curving inwards when excited has never even been suspected. It is necessary to select for experiment leaves with their glands secreting freely, and which have been prevented from capturing many insects; as old leaves, at least those growing in a state of nature, have their margins already curled so much inwards that they exhibit little power of movement, or move very slowly. I will first give in detail the more important experiments which were tried, and then make some concluding remarks. [Experiment 1.—A young and almost upright leaf was selected, with its two lateral edges equally and very slightly incurved. A row of small flies was placed along one margin. When looked at next day, after 15 hrs., this margin, but not the other, was found folded inwards, like the helix of the human ear, to the breadth of 1/10 of an inch, so as to lie partly over the row of flies (fig. 15). The glands on which the flies rested, as well as those on the over-lapping margin which had been brought into contact with the flies, were all secreting copiously. FIG. 15. (Pinguicula vulgaris.) Outline of leaf with left margin inflected over a row of small flies. Experiment 2.—A row of flies was placed on one margin of a rather old leaf, which lay flat on the ground; and in this case the margin, after the same interval as before, namely 15 hrs., had only just begun to curl inwards; but so much secretion had been poured forth that the spoon-shaped tip of the leaf was filled with it. Experiment 3.—Fragments of a large fly were placed close to the apex of a vigorous leaf, as well as along half one margin. [page 372] After 4 hrs. 20 m. there was decided incurvation, which increased a little during the afternoon, but was in the same state on the following morning. Near the apex both margins were inwardly curved. I have never seen a case of the apex itself being in the least curved towards the base of the leaf. After 48 hrs. (always reckoning from the time when the flies were placed on the leaf) the margin had everywhere begun to unfold. Experiment 4.—A large fragment of a fly was placed on a leaf, in a medial line, a little beneath the apex. Both lateral margins were perceptibly incurved in 3 hrs., and after 4 hrs. 20 m. to such a degree that the fragment was clasped by both margins. After 24 hrs. the two infolded edges near the apex (for the lower part of the leaf was not at all affected) were measured and found to be .11 of an inch (2.795 mm.) apart. The fly was now removed, and a stream of water poured over the leaf so as to wash the surface; and after 24 hrs. the margins were .25 of an inch (6.349 mm.) apart, so that they were largely unfolded. After an additional 24 hrs. they were completely unfolded. Another fly was now put on the same spot to see whether this leaf, on which the first fly had been left 24 hrs., would move again; after 10 hrs. there was a trace of incurvation, but this did not increase during the next 24 hrs. A bit of meat was also placed on the margin of a leaf, which four days previously had become strongly incurved over a fragment of a fly and had afterwards re-expanded; but the meat did not cause even a trace of incurvation. On the contrary, the margin became somewhat reflexed, as if injured, and so remained for the three following days, as long as it was observed. Experiment 5.—A large fragment of a fly was placed halfway between the apex and base of a leaf and halfway between the midrib and one margin. A short space of this margin, opposite the fly, showed a trace of incurvation after 3 hrs., and this became strongly pronounced in 7 hrs. After 24 hrs. the infolded edge was only .16 of an inch (4.064 mm.) from the midrib. The margin now began to unfold, though the fly was left on the leaf; so that by the next morning (i.e. 48 hrs. from the time when the fly was first put on) the infolded edge had almost completely recovered its original position, being now .3 of an inch (7.62 mm.), instead of .16 of an inch, from the midrib. A trace of flexure was, however, still visible. Experiment 6.—A young and concave leaf was selected with its margins slightly and naturally incurved. Two rather large, oblong, rectangular pieces of roast meat were placed with their ends touching the infolded edge, and .46 of an inch (11.68 mm.) [page 373] apart from one another. After 24 hrs. the margin was greatly and equally incurved (see fig. 16) throughout this space, and for a length of .12 or .13 of an inch (3.048 or 3.302 mm.) above and below each bit; so that the margin had been affected over a greater length between the two bits, owing to their conjoint action, than beyond them. The bits of meat were too large to be clasped by the margin, but they were tilted up, one of them so as to stand almost vertically. After 48 hrs. the margin was almost unfolded, and the bits had sunk down. When again examined after two days, the margin was quite unfolded, with the exception of the naturally inflected edge; and one of the bits of meat, the end of which had at first touched the edge, was now .067 of an inch (1.70 mm.) distant from it; so that this bit had been pushed thus far across the blade of the leaf. FIG. 16. (Pinguicula vulgaris.) Outline of leaf, with right margin inflected against two square bits of meat. Experiment 7.—A bit of meat was placed close to the incurved edge of a rather young leaf, and after it had re-expanded, the bit was left lying .11 of an inch (2.795 mm.) from the edge. The distance from the edge to the midrib of the fully expanded leaf was .35 of an inch (8.89 mm.); so that the bit had been pushed inwards and across nearly one-third of its semi-diameter. Experiment 8.—Cubes of sponge, soaked in a strong infusion of raw meat, were placed in close contact with the incurved edges of two leaves,—an older and younger one. The distance from the edges to the midribs was carefully measured. After 1 hr. 17 m. there appeared to be a trace of incurvation. After 2 hrs. 17 m. both leaves were plainly inflected; the distance between the edges and midribs being now only half what it was at first. The incurvation increased slightly during the next 4 1/2 hrs., but remained nearly the same for the next 17 hrs. 30 m. In 35 hrs. from the time when the sponges were placed on the leaves, the margins were a little unfolded—to a greater degree in the younger than in the older leaf. The latter was not quite unfolded until the third day, and now both bits of sponge were left at the distance of .1 of an inch (2.54 mm.) from the edges; or about a quarter of the distance between the edge and midrib. A third bit of sponge adhered to the edge, and, as the margin unfolded, was dragged backwards, into its original position. [page 374] Experiment 9.—A chain of fibres of roast meat, as thin as bristles and moistened with saliva, were placed down one whole side, close to the narrow, naturally incurved edge of a leaf. In 3 hrs. this side was greatly incurved along its whole length, and after 8 hrs. formed a cylinder, about 1/20 of an inch (1.27 mm) in diameter, quite concealing the meat. This cylinder remained closed for 32 hrs., but after 48 hrs. was half unfolded, and in 72 hrs. was as open as the opposite margin where no meat had been placed. As the thin fibres of meat were completely overlapped by the margin, they were not pushed at all inwards, across the blade. Experiment 10.—Six cabbage seeds, soaked for a night in water, were placed in a row close to the narrow incurved edge of a leaf. We shall hereafter see that these seeds yield soluble matter to the glands. In 2 hrs. 25 m. the margin was decidedly inflected; in 4 hrs. it extended over the seeds for about half their breadth, and in 7 hrs. over three-fourths of their breadth, forming a cylinder not quite closed along the inner side, and about .7 of an inch (1.778 mm.) in diameter. After 24 hrs. the inflection had not increased, perhaps had decreased. The glands which had been brought into contact with the upper surfaces of the seeds were now secreting freely. In 36 hrs. from the time when the seeds were put on the leaf the margin had greatly, and after 48 hrs. had completely, re-expanded. As the seeds were no longer held by the inflected margin, and as the secretion was beginning to fail, they rolled some way down the marginal channel. Experiment 11.—Fragments of glass were placed on the margins of two fine young leaves. After 2 hrs. 30 m. the margin of one certainly became slightly incurved; but the inflection never increased, and disappeared in 16 hrs. 30 m. from the time when the fragments were first applied. With the second leaf there was a trace of incurvation in 2 hrs. 15 m., which became decided in 4 hrs. 30 m., and still more strongly pronounced in 7 hrs., but after 19 hrs. 30 m. had plainly decreased. The fragments excited at most a slight and doubtful increase of the secretion; and in two other trials, no increase could be perceived. Bits of coal-cinders, placed on a leaf, produced no effect, either owing to their lightness or to the leaf being torpid. Experiment 12.—We now turn to fluids. A row of drops of a strong infusion of raw meat were placed along the margins of two leaves; squares of sponge soaked in the same infusion being placed on the opposite margins. My object was to ascer- [page 375] tain whether a fluid would act as energetically as a substance yielding the same soluble matter to the glands. No distinct difference was perceptible; certainly none in the degree of incurvation; but the incurvation round the bits of sponge lasted rather longer, as might perhaps have been expected from the sponge remaining damp and supplying nitrogenous matter for a longer time. The margins, with the drops, became plainly incurved in 2 hrs. 17 m. The incurvation subsequently increased somewhat, but after 24 hrs. had greatly decreased. Experiment 13.—Drops of the same strong infusion of raw meat were placed along the midrib of a young and rather deeply concave leaf. The distance across the broadest part of the leaf, between the naturally incurved edges, was .55 of an inch (13.97 mm.). In 3 hrs. 27 m. this distance was a trace less; in 6 hrs. 27 m. it was exactly .45 of an inch (11.43 mm.), and had therefore decreased by .1 of an inch (2.54 mm.). After only 10 hrs. 37 m. the margin began to re-expand, for the distance from edge to edge was now a trace wider, and after 24 hrs. 20 m. was as great, within a hair’s breadth, as when the drops were first placed on the leaf. From this experiment we learn that the motor impulse can be transmitted to a distance of .22 of an inch (5.590 mm.) in a transverse direction from the midrib to both margins; but it would be safer to say .2 of an inch (5.08 mm.) as the drops spread a little beyond the midrib. The incurvation thus caused lasted for an unusually short time. Experiment 14.—Three drops of a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 218 of water (2 grs. to 1 oz.) were placed on the margin of a leaf. These excited so much secretion that in 1 h. 22 m. all three drops ran together; but although the leaf was observed for 24 hrs., there was no trace of inflection. We know that a rather strong solution of this salt, though it does not injure the leaves of Drosera, paralyses their power of movement, and I have no doubt, from the following case, that this holds good with Pinguicula. Experiment 15.—A row of drops of a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 875 of water (1 gr. to 2 oz.) was placed on the margin of a leaf. In 1 hr. there was apparently some slight incurvation, and this was well-marked in 3 hrs. 30 m. After 24 hrs. the margin was almost completely re-expanded. Experiment 16.—A row of large drops of a solution of one part of phosphate of ammonia to 4375 of water (1 gr. to 10 oz.) was placed along the margin of a leaf. No effect was produced, and after 8 hrs. fresh drops were added along the same margin without the least effect. We know that a solution of this [page 376] strength acts powerfully on Drosera, and it is just possible that the solution was too strong. I regret that I did not try a weaker solution. Experiment 17.—As the pressure from bits of glass causes incurvation, I scratched the margins of two leaves for some minutes with a blunt needle, but no effect was produced. The surface of a leaf beneath a drop of a strong infusion of raw meat was also rubbed for 10. m. with the end of a bristle, so as to imitate the struggles of a captured insect; but this part of the margin did not bend sooner than the other parts with undisturbed drops of the infusion.] We learn from the foregoing experiments that the margins of the leaves curl inwards when excited by the mere pressure of objects not yielding any soluble matter, by objects yielding such matter, and by some fluids—namely an infusion of raw meat and a week solution of carbonate of ammonia. A stronger solution of two grains of this salt to an ounce of water, though exciting copious secretion, paralyses the leaf. Drops of water and of a solution of sugar or gum did not cause any movement. Scratching the surface of the leaf for some minutes produced no effect. Therefore, as far as we at present know, only two causes—namely slight continued pressure and the absorption of nitrogenous matter—excite movement. It is only the margins of the leaf which bend, for the apex never curves towards the base. The pedicels of the glandular hairs have no power of movement. I observed on several occasions that the surface of the leaf became slightly concave where bits of meat or large flies had long lain, but this may have been due to injury from over-stimulation. The shortest time in which plainly marked movement was observed was 2 hrs. 17 m., and this occurred when either nitrogenous substances or fluids were placed on the leaves; but I believe that in some cases [page 377] there was a trace of movement in 1 hr. or 1 hr. 30 m. The pressure from fragments of glass excites movement almost as quickly as the absorption of nitrogenous matter, but the degree of incurvation thus caused is much less. After a leaf has become well incurved and has again expanded, it will not soon answer to a fresh stimulus. The margin was affected longitudinally, upwards or downwards, for a distance of .13 of an inch (3.302 mm.) from an excited point, but for a distance of .46 of an inch between two excited points, and transversely for a distance of .2 of an inch (5.08 mm.). The motor impulse is not accompanied, as in the case of Drosera, by any influence causing increased secretion; for when a single gland was strongly stimulated and secreted copiously, the surrounding glands were not in the least affected. The incurvation of the margin is independent of increased secretion, for fragments of glass cause little or no secretion, and yet excite movement; whereas a strong solution of carbonate of ammonia quickly excites copious secretion, but no movement. One of the most curious facts with respect to the movement of the leaves is the short time during which they remain incurved, although the exciting object is left on them. In the majority of cases there was well-marked re-expansion within 24 hrs. from the time when even large pieces of meat, &c., were placed on the leaves, and in all cases within 48 hrs. In one instance the margin of a leaf remained for 32 hrs. closely inflected round thin fibres of meat; in another instance, when a bit of sponge, soaked in a strong infusion of raw meat, had been applied to a leaf, the margin began to unfold in 35 hrs. Fragments of glass keep the margin incurved for a shorter time than do nitrogenous bodies; for in the former case there was [page 378] complete re-expansion in 16 hrs. 30 m. Nitrogenous fluids act for a shorter time than nitrogenous substances; thus, when drops of an infusion of raw meat were placed on the midrib of a leaf, the incurved margins began to unfold in only 10 hrs. 37 m., and this was the quickest act of re-expansion observed by me; but it may have been partly due to the distance of the margins from the midrib where the drops lay. We are naturally led to inquire what is the use of this movement which lasts for so short a time? If very small objects, such as fibres of meat, or moderately small objects, such as little flies or cabbage-seeds, are placed close to the margin, they are either completely or partially embraced by it. The glands of the overlapping margin are thus brought into contact with such objects and pour forth their secretion, afterwards absorbing the digested matter. But as the incurvation lasts for so short a time, any such benefit can be of only slight importance, yet perhaps greater than at first appears. The plant lives in humid districts, and the insects which adhere to all parts of the leaf are washed by every heavy shower of rain into the narrow channel formed by the naturally incurved edges. For instance, my friend in North Wales placed several insects on some leaves, and two days afterwards (there having been heavy rain in the interval) found some of them quite washed away, and many others safely tucked under the now closely inflected margins, the glands of which all round the insects were no doubt secreting. We can thus, also, understand how it is that so many insects, and fragments of insects, are generally found lying within the incurved margins of the leaves. The incurvation of the margin, due to the presence of an exciting object, must be serviceable in another [page 379] and probably more important way. We have seen that when large bits of meat, or of sponge soaked in the juice of meat, were placed on a leaf, the margin was not able to embrace them, but, as it became incurved, pushed them very slowly towards the middle of the leaf, to a distance from the outside of fully .1 of an inch (2.54 mm.), that is, across between one-third and one-fourth of the space between the edge and midrib. Any object, such as a moderately sized insect, would thus be brought slowly into contact with a far larger number of glands, inducing much more secretion and absorption, than would otherwise have been the case. That this would be highly serviceable to the plant, we may infer from the fact that Drosera has acquired highly developed powers of movement, merely for the sake of bringing all its glands into contact with captured insects. So again, after a leaf of Dionaea has caught an insect, the slow pressing together of the two lobes serves merely to bring the glands on both sides into contact with it, causing also the secretion charged with animal matter to spread by capillary attraction over the whole surface. In the case of Pinguicula, as soon as an insect has been pushed for some little distance towards the midrib, immediate re-expansion would be beneficial, as the margins could not capture fresh prey until they were unfolded. The service rendered by this pushing action, as well as that from the marginal glands being brought into contact for a short time with the upper surfaces of minute captured insects, may perhaps account for the peculiar movements of the leaves; otherwise, we must look at these movements as a remnant of a more highly developed power formerly possessed by the progenitors of the genus. In the four British species, and, as I hear from [page 380] Prof. Dyer, in most or all the species of the genus, the edges of the leaves are in some degree naturally and permanently incurved. This incurvation serves, as already shown, to prevent insects from being washed away by the rain; but it likewise serves for another end. When a number of glands have been powerfully excited by bits of meat, insects, or any other stimulus, the secretion often trickles down the leaf, and is caught by the incurved edges, instead of rolling off and being lost. As it runs down the channel, fresh glands are able to absorb the animal matter held in solution. Moreover, the secretion often collects in little pools within the channel, or in the spoon-like tips of the leaves; and I ascertained that bits of albumen, fibrin, and gluten, are here dissolved more quickly and completely than on the surface of the leaf, where the secretion cannot accumulate; and so it would be with naturally caught insects. The secretion was repeatedly seen thus to collect on the leaves of plants protected from the rain; and with exposed plants there would be still greater need of some provision to prevent, as far as possible, the secretion, with its dissolved animal matter, being wholly lost. It has already been remarked that plants growing in a state of nature have the margins of their leaves much more strongly incurved than those grown in pots and prevented from catching many insects. We have seen that insects washed down by the rain from all parts of the leaf often lodge within the margins, which are thus excited to curl farther inwards; and we may suspect that this action, many times repeated during the life of the plant, leads to their permanent and well-marked incurvation. I regret that this view did not occur to me in time to test its truth. It may here be added, though not immediately [page 381] bearing on our subject, that when a plant is pulled up, the leaves immediately curl downwards so as almost to conceal the roots,—a fact which has been noticed by many persons. I suppose that this is due to the same tendency which causes the outer and older leaves to lie flat on the ground. It further appears that the flower-stalks are to a certain extent irritable, for Dr. Johnson states that they “bend backwards if rudely handled.”* Secretion, Absorption, and Digestion.—I will first give my observations and experiments, and then a summary of the results. [The Effects of Objects containing Soluble Nitrogenous Matter. (1) Flies were placed on many leaves, and excited the glands to secrete copiously; the secretion always becoming acid, though not so before. After a time these insects were rendered so tender that their limbs and bodies could be separated by a mere touch, owing no doubt to the digestion and disintegration of their muscles. The glands in contact with a small fly continued to secrete for four days, and then became almost dry. A narrow strip of this leaf was cut off, and the glands of the longer and shorter hairs, which had lain in contact for the four days with the fly, and those which had not touched it, were compared under the microscope and presented a wonderful contrast. Those which had been in contact were filled with brownish granular matter, the others with homogeneous fluid. There could therefore be no doubt that the former had absorbed matter from the fly. (2) Small bits of roast meat, placed on a leaf, always caused much acid secretion in the course of a few hours—in one case within 40 m. When thin fibres of meat were laid along the margin of a leaf which stood almost upright, the secretion ran down to the ground. Angular bits of meat, placed in little pools of the secretion near the margin, were in the course of * ‘English Botany,’ by Sir J.E. Smith; with coloured figures by J. Sowerby; edit. of 1832, tab. 24, 25, 26. [page 382] two or three days much reduced in size, rounded, rendered more or less colourless and transparent, and so much softened that they fell to pieces on the slightest touch. In only one instance was a very minute particle completely dissolved, and this occurred within 48 hrs. When only a small amount of secretion was excited, this was generally absorbed in from 24 hrs. to 48 hrs.; the glands being left dry. But when the supply of secretion was copious, round either a single rather large bit of meat, or round several small bits, the glands did not become dry until six or seven days had elapsed. The most rapid case of absorption observed by me was when a small drop of an infusion of raw meat was placed on a leaf, for the glands here became almost dry in 3 hrs. 20 m. Glands excited by small particles of meat, and which have quickly absorbed their own secretion, begin to secrete again in the course of seven or eight days from the time when the meat was given them. (3) Three minute cubes of tough cartilage from the leg-bone of a sheep were laid on a leaf. After 10 hrs. 30 m. some acid secretion was excited, but the cartilage appeared little or not at all affected. After 24 hrs. the cubes were rounded and much reduced in size; after 32 hrs. they were softened to the centre, and one was quite liquefied; after 35 hrs. mere traces of solid cartilage were left; and after 48 hrs. a trace could still be seen through a lens in only one of the three. After 82 hrs. not only were all three cubes completely liquefied, but all the secretion was absorbed and the glands left dry. (4) Small cubes of albumen were placed on a leaf; in 8 hrs. feebly acid secretion extended to a distance of nearly 1/10 of an inch round them, and the angles of one cube were rounded. After 24 hrs. the angles of all the cubes were rounded, and they were rendered throughout very tender; after 30 hrs. the secretion began to decrease, and after 48 hrs. the glands were left dry; but very minute bits of albumen were still left undissolved. (5) Smaller cubes of albumen (about 1/50 or 1/60 of an inch, .508 or .423 mm.) were placed on four glands; after 18 hrs. one cube was completely dissolved, the others being much reduced in size, softened, and transparent. After 24 hrs. two of the cubes were completely dissolved, and already the secretion on these glands was almost wholly absorbed. After 42 hrs. the two other cubes were completely dissolved. These four glands began to secrete again after eight or nine days. (6) Two large cubes of albumen (fully 1/20 of an inch, 1.27 mm.) were placed, one near the midrib and the other near the margin [page 383] of a leaf; in 6 hrs. there was much secretion, which after 48 hrs. accumulated in a little pool round the cube near the margin. This cube was much more dissolved than that on the blade of the leaf; so that after three days it was greatly reduced in size, with all the angles rounded, but it was too large to be wholly dissolved. The secretion was partially absorbed after four days. The cube on the blade was much less reduced, and the glands on which it rested began to dry after only two days. (7) Fibrin excites less secretion than does meat or albumen. Several trials were made, but I will give only three of them. Two minute shreds were placed on some glands, and in 3 hrs. 45 m. their secretion was plainly increased. The smaller shred of the two was completely liquefied in 6 hrs. 15 m., and the other in 24 hrs.; but even after 48 hrs. a few granules of fibrin could still be seen through a lens floating in both drops of secretion. After 56 hrs. 30 m. these granules were completely dissolved. A third shred was placed in a little pool of secretion, within the margin of a leaf where a seed had been lying, and this was completely dissolved in the course of 15 hrs. 30 m. (8) Five very small bits of gluten were placed on a leaf, and they excited so much secretion that one of the bits glided down into the marginal furrow. After a day all five bits seemed much reduced in size, but none were wholly dissolved. On the third day I pushed two of them, which had begun to dry, on to fresh glands. On the fourth day undissolved traces of three out of the five bits could still be detected, the other two having quite disappeared; but I am doubtful whether they had really been completely dissolved. Two fresh bits were now placed, one near the middle and the other near the margin of another leaf; both excited an extraordinary amount of secretion; that near the margin had a little pool formed round it, and was much more reduced in size than that on the blade, but after four days was not completely dissolved. Gluten, therefore, excites the glands greatly, but is dissolved with much difficulty, exactly as in the case of Drosera. I regret that I did not try this substance after having been immersed in weak hydrochloric acid, as it would then probably have been quickly dissolved. (9) A small square thin piece of pure gelatine, moistened with water, was placed on a leaf, and excited very little secretion in 5 hrs. 30 m., but later in the day a greater amount. After 24 hrs. the whole square was completely liquefied; and this would not have occurred had it been left in water. The liquid was acid. (10) Small particles of chemically prepared casein excited [page 384] acid secretion, but were not quite dissolved after two days; and the glands then began to dry. Nor could their complete dissolution have been expected from what we have seen with Drosera. (11) Minute drops of skimmed milk were placed on a leaf, and these caused the glands to secrete freely. After 3 hrs. the milk was found curdled, and after 23 hrs. the curds were dissolved. On placing the now clear drops under the microscope, nothing could be detected except some oil-globules. The secretion, therefore, dissolves fresh casein. (12) Two fragments of a leaf were immersed for 17 hrs., each in a drachm of a solution of carbonate of ammonia, of two strengths, namely of one part to 437 and 218 of water. The glands of the longer and shorter hairs were then examined, and their contents found aggregated into granular matter of a brownish-green colour. These granular masses were seen by my son slowly to change their forms, and no doubt consisted of protoplasm. The aggregation was more strongly pronounced, and the movements of the protoplasm more rapid, within the glands subjected to the stronger solution than in the others. The experiment was repeated with the same result; and on this occasion I observed that the protoplasm had shrunk a little from the walls of the single elongated cells forming the pedicels. In order to observe the process of aggregation, a narrow strip of leaf was laid edgeways under the microscope, and the glands were seen to be quite transparent; a little of the stronger solution (viz. one part to 218 of water) was now added under the covering glass; after an hour or two the glands contained very fine granular matter, which slowly became coarsely granular and slightly opaque; but even after 5 hrs. not as yet of a brownish tint. By this time a few rather large, transparent, globular masses appeared within the upper ends of the pedicels, and the protoplasm lining their walls had shrunk a little. It is thus evident that the glands of Pinguicula absorb carbonate of ammonia; but they do not absorb it, or are not acted on by it, nearly so quickly as those of Drosera. (13) Little masses of the orange-coloured pollen of the common pea, placed on several leaves, excited the glands to secrete freely. Even a very few grains which accidentally fell on a single gland caused the drop surrounding it to increase so much in size, in 23 hrs., as to be manifestly larger than the drops on the adjoining glands. Grains subjected to the secretion for 48 hrs. did not emit their tubes; they were quite discoloured, and seemed to contain less matter than before; that [page 385] which was left being of a dirty colour, including globules of oil. They thus differed in appearance from other grains kept in water for the same length of time. The glands in contact with the pollen-grains had evidently absorbed matter from them; for they had lost their natural pale-green tint, and contained aggregated globular masses of protoplasm. (14) Square bits of the leaves of spinach, cabbage, and a saxifrage, and the entire leaves of Erica tetralix, all excited the glands to increased secretion. The spinach was the most effective, for it caused the secretion evidently to increase in 1 hr. 40 m., and ultimately to run some way down the leaf; but the glands soon began to dry, viz. after 35 hrs. The leaves of Erica tetralix began to act in 7 hrs. 30 m., but never caused much secretion; nor did the bits of leaf of the saxifrage, though in this case the glands continued to secrete for seven days. Some leaves of Pinguicula were sent me from North Wales, to which leaves of Erica tetralixand of an unknown plant adhered; and the glands in contact with them had their contents plainly aggregated, as if they had been in contact with insects; whilst the other glands on the same leaves contained only clear homogeneous fluid. (15) Seeds.—A considerable number of seeds or fruits selected by hazard, some fresh and some a year old, some soaked for a short time in water and some not soaked, were tried. The ten following kinds, namely cabbage, radish, Anemone nemorosa, Rumex acetosa, Carex sylvatica, mustard, turnip, cress, Ranunculus acris, and Avena pubescens, all excited much secretion, which was in several cases tested and found always acid. The five first-named seeds excited the glands more than the others. The secretion was seldom copious until about 24 hrs. had elapsed, no doubt owing to the coats of the seeds not being easily permeable. Nevertheless, cabbage seeds excited some secretion in 4 hrs. 30 m.; and this increased so much in 18 hrs. as to run down the leaves. The seeds or properly the fruits of Carex are much oftener found adhering to leaves in a state of nature than those of any other genus; and the fruits of Carex sylvatica excited so much secretion that in 15 hrs. it ran into the incurved edges; but the glands ceased to secrete after 40 hrs. On the other hand, the glands on which the seeds of the Rumex and Avena rested continued to secrete for nine days. The nine following kinds of seeds excited only a slight amount of secretion, namely, celery, parsnip, caraway, Linum grandiflorum, Cassia, Trifolium pannonicum, Plantago, onion, [page 386] and Bromus. Most of these seeds did not excite any secretion until 48 hrs. had elapsed, and in the case of the Trifolium only one seed acted, and this not until the third day. Although the seeds of the Plantago excited very little secretion, the glands continued to secrete for six days. Lastly, the five following kinds excited no secretion, though left on the leaves for two or three days, namely lettuce, Erica tetralix, Atriplex hortensis, Phalaris canariensis, and wheat. Nevertheless, when the seeds of the lettuce, wheat, and Atriplex were split open and applied to leaves, secretion was excited in considerable quantity in 10 hrs., and I believe that some was excited in six hours. In the case of the Atriplex the secretion ran down to the margin, and after 24 hrs. I speak of it in my notes “as immense in quantity and acid.” The split seeds also of the Trifolium and celery acted powerfully and quickly, though the whole seeds caused, as we have seen, very little secretion, and only after a long interval of time. A slice of the common pea, which however was not tried whole, caused secretion in 2 hrs. From these facts we may conclude that the great difference in the degree and rate at which various kinds of seeds excite secretion, is chiefly or wholly due to the different permeability of their coats. Some thin slices of the common pea, which had been previously soaked for 1 hr. in water, were placed on a leaf, and quickly excited much acid secretion. After 24 hrs. these slices were compared under a high power with others left in water for the same time; the latter contained so many fine granules of legumin that the slide was rendered muddy; whereas the slices which had been subjected to the secretion were much cleaner and more transparent, the granules of legumin apparently having been dissolved. A cabbage seed which had lain for two days on a leaf and had excited much acid secretion, was cut into slices, and these were compared with those of a seed which had been left for the same time in water. Those subjected to the secretion were of a paler colour; their coats presenting the greatest differences, for they were of a pale dirty tint instead of chestnut-brown. The glands on which the cabbage seeds had rested, as well as those bathed by the surrounding secretion, differed greatly in appearance from the other glands on the same leaf, for they all contained brownish granular matter, proving that they had absorbed matter from the seeds. That the secretion acts on the seeds was also shown by some of them being killed, or by the seedlings being injured. Fourteen cabbage seeds were left for three days on leaves and excited [page 387] much secretion; they were then placed on damp sand under conditions known to be favourable for germination. Three never germinated, and this was a far larger proportion of deaths than occurred with seeds of the same lot, which had not been subjected to the secretion, but were otherwise treated in the same manner. Of the eleven seedlings raised, three had the edges of their cotyledons slightly browned, as if scorched; and the cotyledons of one grew into a curious indented shape. Two mustard seeds germinated; but their cotyledons were marked with brown patches and their radicles deformed. Of two radish seeds, neither germinated; whereas of many seeds of the same lot not subjected to the secretion, all, excepting one, germinated. Of the two Rumex seeds, one died and the other germinated; but its radicle was brown and soon withered. Both seeds of the Avena germinated, one grew well, the other had its radicle brown and withered. Of six seeds of the Erica none germinated, and when cut open after having been left for five months on damp sand, one alone seemed alive. Twenty-two seeds of various kinds were found adhering to the leaves of plants growing in a state of nature; and of these, though kept for five months on damp sand, none germinated, some being then evidently dead. The Effects of Objects not containing Soluble Nitrogenous Matter. (16) It has already been shown that bits of glass, placed on leaves, excite little or no secretion. The small amount which lay beneath the fragments was tested and found not acid. A bit of wood excited no secretion; nor did the several kinds of seeds of which the coats are not permeable to the secretion, and which, therefore, acted like inorganic bodies. Cubes of fat, left for two days on a leaf, produced no effect. (17) A particle of white sugar, placed on a leaf, formed in 1 hr. 10 m. a large drop of fluid, which in the course of 2 additional hours ran down into the naturally inflected margin. This fluid was not in the least acid, and began to dry up, or more probably was absorbed, in 5 hrs. 30 m. The experiment was repeated; particles being placed on a leaf, and others of the same size on a slip of glass in a moistened state; both being covered by a bell-glass. This was done to see whether the increased amount of fluid on the leaves could be due to mere deliquescence; but this was proved not to be the case. The particle on the leaf caused so much secretion that in the course of 4 hrs. it ran down across two-thirds of the leaf. After 8 hrs. the leaf, which was concave, was actually filled with very viscid [page 388] fluid; and it particularly deserves notice that this, as on the former occasion, was not in the least acid. This great amount of secretion may be attributed to exosmose. The glands which had been covered for 24 hrs. by this fluid did not differ, when examined under the microscope, from others on the same leaf, which had not come into contact with it. This is an interesting fact in contrast with the invariably aggregated condition of glands which have been bathed by the secretion, when holding animal matter in solution. (18) Two particles of gum arabic were placed on a leaf, and they certainly caused in 1 hr. 20 m. a slight increase of secretion. This continued to increase for the next 5 hrs., that is for as long a time as the leaf was observed. (19) Six small particles of dry starch of commerce were placed on a leaf, and one of these caused some secretion in 1 hr. 15 m., and the others in from 8 hrs. to 9 hrs. The glands which had thus been excited to secrete soon became dry, and did not begin to secrete again until the sixth day. A larger bit of starch was then placed on a leaf, and no secretion was excited in 5 hrs. 30 m.; but after 8 hrs. there was a considerable supply, which increased so much in 24 hrs. as to run down the leaf to the distance of 3/4 of an inch. This secretion, though so abundant, was not in the least acid. As it was so copiously excited, and as seeds not rarely adhere to the leaves of naturally growing plants, it occurred to me that the glands might perhaps have the power of secreting a ferment, like ptyaline, capable of dissolving starch; so I carefully observed the above six small particles during several days, but they did not seem in the least reduced in bulk. A particle was also left for two days in a little pool of secretion, which had run down from a piece of spinach leaf; but although the particle was so minute no diminution was perceptible. We may therefore conclude that the secretion cannot dissolve starch. The increase caused by this substance may, I presume, be attributed to exosmose. But I am surprised that starch acted so quickly and powerfully as it did, though in a less degree than sugar. Colloids are known to possess some slight power of dialysis; and on placing the leaves of a Primula in water, and others in syrup and diffused starch, those in the starch became flaccid, but to a less degree and at a much slower rate than the leaves in the syrup; those in water remaining all the time crisp.] From the foregoing experiments and observations we [page 389] see that objects not containing soluble matter have little or no power of exciting the glands to secrete. Non-nitrogenous fluids, if dense, cause the glands to pour forth a large supply of viscid fluid, but this is not in the least acid. On the other hand, the secretion from glands excited by contact with nitrogenous solids or liquids is invariably acid, and is so copious that it often runs down the leaves and collects within the naturally incurved margins. The secretion in this state has the power of quickly dissolving, that is of digesting, the muscles of insects, meat, cartilage, albumen, fibrin, gelatine, and casein as it exists in the curds of milk. The glands are strongly excited by chemically prepared casein and gluten; but these substances (the latter not having been soaked in weak hydrochloric acid) are only partially dissolved, as was likewise the case with Drosera. The secretion, when containing animal matter in solution, whether derived from solids or from liquids, such as an infusion of raw meat, milk, or a weak solution of carbonate of ammonia, is quickly absorbed; and the glands, which were before limpid and of a greenish colour, become brownish and contain masses of aggregated granular matter. This matter, from its spontaneous movements, no doubt consists of protoplasm. No such effect is produced by the action of non-nitrogenous fluids. After the glands have been excited to secrete freely, they cease for a time to secrete, but begin again in the course of a few days. Glands in contact with pollen, the leaves of other plants, and various kinds of seeds, pour forth much acid secretion, and afterwards absorb matter probably of an albuminous nature from them. Nor can the benefit thus derived be insignificant, for a considerable [page 390] amount of pollen must be blown from the many wind-fertilised carices, grasses, &c., growing where Pinguicula lives, on to the leaves thickly covered with viscid glands and forming large rosettes. Even a few grains of pollen on a single gland causes it to secrete copiously. We have also seen how frequently the small leaves of Erica tetralix and of other plants, as well as various kinds of seeds and fruits, especially of Carex, adhere to the leaves. One leaf of the Pinguicula had caught ten of the little leaves of the Erica; and three leaves on the same plant had each caught a seed. Seeds subjected to the action of the secretion are sometimes killed, or the seedlings injured. We may, therefore, conclude that Pinguicula vulgaris, with its small roots, is not only supported to a large extent by the extraordinary number of insects which it habitually captures, but likewise draws some nourishment from the pollen, leaves, and seeds of other plants which often adhere to its leaves. It is therefore partly a vegetable as well as an animal feeder. PINGUICULA GRANDIFLORA. This species is so closely allied to the last that it is ranked by Dr. Hooker as a sub-species. It differs chiefly in the larger size of its leaves, and in the glandular hairs near the basal part of the midrib being longer. But it likewise differs in constitution; I hear from Mr. Ralfs, who was so kind as to send me plants from Cornwall, that it grows in rather different sites; and Dr. Moore, of the Glasnevin Botanic Gardens, informs me that it is much more manageable under culture, growing freely and flowering annually; whilst Pinguicula vulgaris has to be renewed every year. Mr. Ralfs found numerous [page 391] insects and fragments of insects adhering to almost all the leaves. These consisted chiefly of Diptera, with some Hymenoptera, Homoptera, Coleoptera, and a moth. On one leaf there were nine dead insects, besides a few still alive. He also observed a few fruits of Carex pulicaris, as well as the seeds of this same Pinguicula, adhering to the leaves. I tried only two experiments with this species; firstly, a fly was placed near the margin of a leaf, and after 16 hrs. this was found well inflected. Secondly, several small flies were placed in a row along one margin of another leaf, and by the next morning this whole margin was curled inwards, exactly as in the case of Pinguicula vulgaris. PINGUICULA LUSITANICA. This species, of which living specimens were sent me by Mr. Ralfs from Cornwall, is very distinct from the two foregoing ones. The leaves are rather smaller, much more transparent, and are marked with purple branching veins. The margins of the leaves are much more involuted; those of the older ones extending over a third of the space between the midrib and the outside. As in the two other species, the glandular hairs consist of longer and shorter ones, and have the same structure; but the glands differ in being purple, and in often containing granular matter before they have been excited. In the lower part of the leaf, almost half the space on each side between the midrib and margin is destitute of glands; these being replaced by long, rather stiff, multicellular hairs, which intercross over the midrib. These hairs perhaps serve to prevent insects from settling on this part of the leaf, where there are no viscid glands by which they could be caught; but it is hardly probable that they were developed for this purpose. The spiral vessels pro- [page 392] ceeding from the midrib terminate at the extreme margin of the leaf in spiral cells; but these are not so well developed as in the two preceding species. The flower-peduncles, sepals, and petals, are studded with glandular hairs, like those on the leaves. The leaves catch many small insects, which are found chiefly beneath the involuted margins, probably washed there by the rain. The colour of the glands on which insects have long lain is changed, being either brownish or pale purple, with their contents coarsely granular; so that they evidently absorb matter from their prey. Leaves of the Erica tetralix, flowers of a Galium, scales of grasses, &c. likewise adhered to some of the leaves. Several of the experiments which were tried on Pinguicula vulgaris were repeated on Pinguicula lusitanica, and these will now be given. [(1) A moderately sized and angular bit of albumen was placed on one side of a leaf, halfway between the midrib and the naturally involuted margin. In 2 hrs. 15 m. the glands poured forth much secretion, and this side became more infolded than the opposite one. The inflection increased, and in 3 hrs. 30 m. extended up almost to the apex. After 24 hrs. the margin was rolled into a cylinder, the outer surface of which touched the blade of the leaf and reached to within the 1/20 of an inch of the midrib. After 48 hrs. it began to unfold, and in 72 hrs. was completely unfolded. The cube was rounded and greatly reduced in size; the remainder being in a semi-liquefied state. (2) A moderately sized bit of albumen was placed near the apex of a leaf, under the naturally incurved margin. In 2 hrs. 30 m. much secretion was excited, and next morning the margin on this side was more incurved than the opposite one, but not to so great a degree as in the last case. The margin unfolded at the same rate as before. A large proportion of the albumen was dissolved, a remnant being still left. (3) Large bits of albumen were laid in a row on the midribs of two leaves, but produced in the course of 24 hrs. no effect; [page 393] nor could this have been expected, for even had glands existed here, the long bristles would have prevented the albumen from coming in contact with them. On both leaves the bits were now pushed close to one margin, and in 3 hrs. 30 m. this became so greatly inflected that the outer surface touched the blade; the opposite margin not being in the least affected. After three days the margins of both leaves with the albumen were still as much inflected as ever, and the glands were still secreting copiously. With Pinguicula vulgaris I have never seen inflection lasting so long. (4) Two cabbage seeds, after being soaked for an hour in water, were placed near the margin of a leaf, and caused in 3 hrs. 20 m. increased secretion and incurvation. After 24 hrs. the leaf was partially unfolded, but the glands were still secreting freely. These began to dry in 48 hrs., and after 72 hrs. were almost dry. The two seeds were then placed on damp sand under favourable conditions for growth; but they never germinated, and after a time were found rotten. They had no doubt been killed by the secretion. (5) Small bits of a spinach leaf caused in 1 hr. 20 m. increased secretion; and after 3 hrs. 20 m. plain incurvation of the margin. The margin was well inflected after 9 hrs. 15 m., but after 24 hrs. was almost fully re-expanded. The glands in contact with the spinach became dry in 72 hrs. Bits of albumen had been placed the day before on the opposite margin of this same leaf, as well as on that of a leaf with cabbage seeds, and these margins remained closely inflected for 72 hrs., showing how much more enduring is the effect of albumen than of spinach leaves or cabbage seeds . (6) A row of small fragments of glass was laid along one margin of a leaf; no effect was produced in 2 hrs. 10 m., but after 3 hrs. 25 m. there seemed to be a trace of inflection, and this was distinct, though not strongly marked, after 6 hrs. The glands in contact with the fragments now secreted more freely than before; so that they appear to be more easily excited by the pressure of inorganic objects than are the glands of Pinguicula vulgaris. The above slight inflection of the margin had not increased after 24 hrs., and the glands were now beginning to dry. The surface of a leaf, near the midrib and towards the base, was rubbed and scratched for some time, but no movement ensued. The long hairs which are situated here were treated in the same manner, with no effect. This latter trial was made because I thought that the hairs might perhaps be sensitive to a touch, like the filaments of Dionaea. [page 394] (7) The flower-peduncles, sepals and petals, bear glands in general appearance like those on the leaves. A piece of a flower-peduncle was therefore left for 1 hr. in a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 437 of water, and this caused the glands to change from bright pink to a dull purple colour; but their contents exhibited no distinct aggregation. After 8 hrs. 30 m. they became colourless. Two minute cubes of albumen were placed on the glands of a flower-peduncle, and another cube on the glands of a sepal; but they were not excited to increased secretion, and the albumen after two days was not in the least softened. Hence these glands apparently differ greatly in function from those on the leaves.] From the foregoing observations on Pinguicula lusitanica we see that the naturally much incurved margins of the leaves are excited to curve still farther inwards by contact with organic and inorganic bodies; that albumen, cabbage seeds, bits of spinach leaves, and fragments of glass, cause the glands to secrete more freely;—that albumen is dissolved by the secretion, and cabbage seeds killed by it;—and lastly that matter is absorbed by the glands from the insects which are caught in large numbers by the viscid secretion. The glands on the flower-peduncles seem to have no such power. This species differs from Pinguicula vulgarisand grandiflora in the margins of the leaves, when excited by organic bodies, being inflected to a greater degree, and in the inflection lasting for a longer time. The glands, also, seem to be more easily excited to increased secretion by bodies not yielding soluble nitrogenous matter. In other respects, as far as my observations serve, all three species agree in their functional powers. [page 395] ',\n",

I was led to investigate the habits and structure of the species of this genus partly from their belonging to the same natural family as Pinguicula, but more especially by Mr. Holland’s statement, that “water insects are often found imprisoned in the bladders,” which he suspects “are destined for the plant to feed on.”* The plants which I first received as Utricularia vulgaris from the New Forest in Hampshire and from Cornwall, and which I have chiefly worked on, have been determined by Dr. Hooker to be a very rare British species, the Utricularia neglecta of Lehm.** I subsequently received the true Utricularia vulgaris from Yorkshire. Since drawing up the following description from my own observations and those of my son, Francis Darwin, an important memoir by Prof. Cohn * The ‘Quart. Mag. of the High Wycombe Nat. Hist. Soc.’ July 1868, p. 5. Delpino (‘Ult. Osservaz. sulla Dicogamia,’ &c. 1868-1869, p. 16) also quotes Crouan as having found (1858) crustaceans within the bladders of Utricularia vulgaris. ** I am much indebted to the Rev. H.M. Wilkinson, of Bistern, for having sent me several fine lots of this species from the New Forest. Mr. Ralfs was also so kind as to send me living plants of the same species from near Penzance in Cornwall. [page 396] on Utricularia vulgaris has appeared;* and it has been no small satisfaction to me to find that my account agrees almost completely with that of this distinguished observer. I will publish my description as it stood before reading that by Prof. Cohn, adding occasionally some statements on his authority. FIG. 17. (Utricularia neglecta.) Branch with the divided leaves bearing bladders; about twice enlarged. Utricularia neglecta.—The general appearance of a branch (about twice enlarged), with the pinnatifid leaves bearing bladders, is represented in the above sketch (fig. 17). The leaves continually bifurcate, so that a full-grown one terminates in from twenty to thirty * ‘Beitrage zur Biologie der Plflanzen’ drittes Heft, 1875. [page 397] points. Each point is tipped by a short, straight bristle; and slight notches on the sides of the leaves bear similar bristles. On both surfaces there are many small papillae, crowned with two hemispherical cells in close contact. The plants float near the surface of the water, and are quite destitute of roots, even during the earliest period of growth.* They commonly inhabit, as more than one observer has remarked to me, remarkably foul ditches. The bladders offer the chief point of interest. There are often two or three on the same divided leaf, generally near the base; though I have seen a single one growing from the stem. They are supported on short footstalks. When fully grown, they are nearly 1/10 of an inch (2.54 mm.) in length. They are translucent, of a green colour, and the walls are formed of two layers of cells. The exterior cells are polygonal and rather large; but at many of the points where the angles meet, there are smaller rounded cells. These latter support short conical projections, surmounted by two hemispherical cells in such close apposition that they appear united; but they often separate a little when immersed in certain fluids. The papillae thus formed are exactly like those on the surfaces of the leaves. Those on the same bladder vary much in size; and there are a few, especially on very young bladders, which have an elliptical instead of a circular outline. The two terminal cells are transparent, but must hold much matter in solution, judging from the quantity coagulated by prolonged immersion in alcohol or ether. * I infer that this is the case from a drawing of a seedling given by Dr. Warming in his paper, “Bidrag til Kundskaben om Lentibulariaceae,” from the ‘Videnskabelige Meddelelser,’ Copenhagen, 1874, Nos. 3-7, pp. 33-58.) [page 398] The bladders are filled with water. They generally, but by no means always, contain bubbles of air. According to the quantity of the contained water and air, they vary much in thickness, but are always somewhat compressed. At an early stage of growth, the flat or ventral surface faces the axis or stem; but the footstalks must have some power of movement; for in plants kept in my greenhouse the ventral surface was generally turned either straight or obliquely downwards. The Rev. H.M. Wilkinson examined FIG. 18. (Utricularia neglecta.) Bladder; much enlarged. c, collar indistinctly seen through the walls. plants for me in a state of nature, and found this commonly to be the case, but the younger bladders often had their valves turned upwards. The general appearance of a bladder viewed laterally, with the appendages on the near side alone represented, is shown in the accompanying figure (fig. 18). The lower side, where the footstalk arises, is nearly straight, and I have called it the ventral surface. The other or dorsal surface is convex, and terminates in two long prolongations, formed of several rows of cells, containing chlorophyll, and bearing, chiefly on [page 399] the outside, six or seven long, pointed, multicellular bristles. These prolongations of the bladder may be conveniently called the antennæ, for the whole bladder (see fig. 17) curiously resembles an entomostracan crustacean, the short footstalk representing the tail. In fig. 18, the near antenna alone is shown. Beneath the two antennæ the end of the bladder is slightly truncated, and here is situated the most important part of the whole structure, namely the entrance and valve. On each side of the entrance from three to rarely seven long, multicellular bristles project out- FIG. 19. (Utricularia neglecta.) Valve of bladder; greatly enlarged. wards; but only those (four in number) on the near side are shown in the drawing. These bristles, together with those borne by the antennæ, form a sort of hollow cone surrounding the entrance. The valve slopes into the cavity of the bladder, or upwards in fig. 18. It is attached on all sides to the bladder, excepting by its posterior margin, or the lower one in fig. 19, which is free, and forms one side of the slit-like orifice leading into the bladder. This margin is sharp, thin, and smooth, and rests on the edge of a rim or collar, which dips deeply into the [page 400] bladder, as shown in the longitudinal section (fig. 20) of the collar and valve; it is also shown at c, in fig. 18. The edge of the valve can thus open only inwards. As both the valve and collar dip into the bladder, a hollow or depression is here formed, at the base of which lies the slit-like orifice. The valve is colourless, highly transparent, flexible and elastic. It is convex in a transverse direction, but has been drawn (fig. 19) in a flattened state, by which its apparent breadth is increased. It is formed, FIG. 20. (Utricularia neglecta.) Longitudinal vertical section through the ventral portion of a bladder; showing valve and collar. v, valve; the whole projection above c forms the collar; b, bifid processes; s, ventral surface of bladder. according to Cohn, of two layers of small cells, which are continuous with the two layers of larger cells forming the walls of the bladder, of which it is evidently a prolongation. Two pairs of transparent pointed bristles, about as long as the valve itself, arise from near the free posterior margin (fig. 18), and point obliquely outwards in the direction of the antennæ. There are also on the surface of the valve numerous glands, as I will call them; for they have the power of absorption, though I doubt whether they ever secrete. They consist of three kinds, which [page 401] to a certain extent graduate into one another. Those situated round the anterior margin of the valve (upper margin in fig. 19) are very numerous and crowded together; they consist of an oblong head on a long pedicel. The pedicel itself is formed of an elongated cell, surmounted by a short one. The glands towards the free posterior margin are much larger, few in number, and almost spherical, having short footstalks; the head is formed by the confluence of two cells, the lower one answering to the short upper cell of the pedicel of the oblong glands. The glands of the third kind have transversely elongated heads, and are seated on very short footstalks; so that they stand parallel and close to the surface of the valve; they may be called the two-armed glands. The cells forming all these glands contain a nucleus, and are lined by a thin layer of more or less granular protoplasm, the primordial utricle of Mohl. They are filled with fluid, which must hold much matter in solution, judging from the quantity coagulated after they have been long immersed in alcohol or ether. The depression in which the valve lies is also lined with innumerable glands; those at the sides having oblong heads and elongated pedicels, exactly like the glands on the adjoining parts of the valve. The collar (called the peristome by Cohn) is evidently formed, like the valve, by an inward projection of the walls of the bladder. The cells composing the outer surface, or that facing the valve, have rather thick walls, are of a brownish colour, minute, very numerous, and elongated; the lower ones being divided into two by vertical partitions. The whole presents a complex and elegant appearance. The cells forming the inner surface are continuous with those over the whole inner surface of the bladder. The space be- [page 402] tween the inner and outer surface consists of coarse cellular tissue (fig. 20). The inner side is thickly covered with delicate bifid processes, hereafter to be described. The collar is thus made thick; and it is rigid, so that it retains the same outline whether the bladder contains little or much air and water. This is of great importance, as otherwise the thin and flexible valve would be liable to be distorted, and in this case would not act properly. Altogether the entrance into the bladder, formed by the transparent valve, with its four obliquely projecting bristles, its numerous diversely shaped glands, surrounded by the collar, bearing glands on the inside and bristles on the outside, together with the bristles borne by the antennæ, presents an extraordinarily complex appearance when viewed under the microscope. We will now consider the internal structure of the bladder. The whole inner surface, with the exception of the valve, is seen under a moderately high power to be covered with a serried mass of processes (fig. 21). Each of these consists of four divergent arms; whence their name of quadrifid processes. They arise from small angular cells, at the junctions of the angles of the larger cells which form the interior of the bladder. The middle part of the upper surface of these small cells projects a little, and then contracts into a very short and narrow footstalk which bears the four arms (fig. 22.). Of these, two are long, but often of not quite equal length, and project obliquely inwards and towards the posterior end of the bladder. The two others are much shorter, and project at a smaller angle, that is, are more nearly horizontal, and are directed towards the anterior end of the bladder. These arms are only moderately sharp; they are composed of ex- [page 403] tremely thin transparent membrane, so that they can be bent or doubled in any direction without being broken. They are lined with a delicate layer of protoplasm, as is likewise the short conical projection from which they arise. Each arm generally (but not invariably) contains a minute, faintly brown particle, either rounded or more commonly elongated, which exhibits incessant Brownian movements. These par- FIG. 21.

One of the quadrifid processes greatly enlarged. ticles slowly change their positions, and travel from one end to the other of the arms, but are commonly found near their bases. They are present in the quadrifids of young bladders, when only about a third of their full size. They do not resemble ordinary nuclei, but I believe that they are nuclei in a modified condition, for when absent, I could occasionally just distinguish in their places a delicate halo of matter, including a darker spot. Moreover, the quadrifids of Utricularia montana contain rather larger and much [page 404] more regularly spherical, but otherwise similar, particles, which closely resemble the nuclei in the cells forming the walls of the bladders. In the present case there were sometimes two, three, or even more, nearly similar particles within a single arm; but, as we shall hereafter see, the presence of more than one seemed always to be connected with the absorption of decayed matter. The inner side of the collar (see the previous fig. 20) is covered with several crowded rows of processes, differing in no important respect from the quadrifids, except in bearing only two arms instead of four; they are, however, rather narrower and more delicate. I shall call them the bifids. They project into the bladder, and are directed towards its posterior end. The quadrifid and bifid processes no doubt are homologous with the papillae on the outside of the bladder and of the leaves; and we shall see that they are developed from closely similar papillae. The Uses of the several Parts.—After the above long but necessary description of the parts, we will turn to their uses. The bladders have been supposed by some authors to serve as floats; but branches which bore no bladders, and others from which they had been removed, floated perfectly, owing to the air in the intercellular spaces. Bladders containing dead and captured animals usually include bubbles of air, but these cannot have been generated solely by the process of decay, as I have often seen air in young, clean, and empty bladders; and some old bladders with much decaying matter had no bubbles. The real use of the bladders is to capture small aquatic animals, and this they do on a large scale. In the first lot of plants, which I received from the New Forest early in July, a large proportion of the fully [page 405] grown bladders contained prey; in a second lot, received in the beginning of August, most of the bladders were empty, but plants had been selected which had grown in unusually pure water. In the first lot, my son examined seventeen bladders, including prey of some kind, and eight of these contained entomostracan crustaceans, three larvæ of insects, one being still alive, and six remnants of animals so much decayed that their nature could not be distinguished. I picked out five bladders which seemed very full, and found in them four, five, eight, and ten crustaceans, and in the fifth a single much elongated larva. In five other bladders, selected from containing remains, but not appearing very full, there were one, two, four, two, and five crustaceans. A plant of Utricularia vulgaris, which had been kept in almost pure water, was placed by Cohn one evening into water swarming with crustaceans, and by the next morning most of the bladders contained these animals entrapped and swimming round and round their prisons. They remained alive for several days; but at last perished, asphyxiated, as I suppose, by the oxygen in the water having been all consumed. Freshwater worms were also found by Cohn in some bladders. In all cases the bladders with decayed remains swarmed with living Algae of many kinds, Infusoria, and other low organisms, which evidently lived as intruders. Animals enter the bladders by bending inwards the posterior free edge of the valve, which from being highly elastic shuts again instantly. As the edge is extremely thin, and fits closely against the edge of the collar, both projecting into the bladder (see section, fig. 20), it would evidently be very difficult for any animal to get out when once imprisoned, and apparently they never do escape. To show how closely the edge [page 406] fits, I may mention that my son found a Daphnia which had inserted one of its antennæ into the slit, and it was thus held fast during a whole day. On three or four occasions I have seen long narrow larvæ, both dead and alive, wedged between the corner of the valve and collar, with half their bodies within the bladder and half out. As I felt much difficulty in understanding how such minute and weak animals, as are often captured, could force their way into the bladders, I tried many experiments to ascertain how this was effected. The free margin of the valve bends so easily that no resistance is felt when a needle or thin bristle is inserted. A thin human hair, fixed to a handle, and cut off so as to project barely 1/4 of an inch, entered with some difficulty; a longer piece yielded instead of entering. On three occasions minute particles of blue glass (so as to be easily distinguished) were placed on valves whilst under water; and on trying gently to move them with a needle, they disappeared so suddenly that, not seeing what had happened, I thought that I had flirted them off; but on examining the bladders, they were found safely enclosed. The same thing occurred to my son, who placed little cubes of green box-wood (about 1/60 of an inch, .423 mm.) on some valves; and thrice in the act of placing them on, or whilst gently moving them to another spot, the valve suddenly opened and they were engulfed. He then placed similar bits of wood on other valves, and moved them about for some time, but they did not enter. Again, particles of blue glass were placed by me on three valves, and extremely minute shavings of lead on two other valves; after 1 or 2 hrs. none had entered, but in from 2 to 5 hrs. all five were enclosed. One of the particles of glass was a [page 407] long splinter, of which one end rested obliquely on the valve, and after a few hours it was found fixed, half within the bladder and half projecting out, with the edge of the valve fitting closely all round, except at one angle, where a small open space was left. It was so firmly fixed, like the above-mentioned larvæ, that the bladder was torn from the branch and shaken, and yet the splinter did not fall out. My son also placed little cubes (about 1/65 of an inch, .391 mm.) of green box-wood, which were just heavy enough to sink in water, on three valves. These were examined after 19 hrs. 30 m., and were still lying on the valves; but after 22 hrs. 30 m. one was found enclosed. I may here mention that I found in a bladder on a naturally growing plant a grain of sand, and in another bladder three grains; these must have fallen by some accident on the valves, and then entered like the particles of glass. The slow bending of the valve from the weight of particles of glass and even of box-wood, though largely supported by the water, is, I suppose, analogous to the slow bending of colloid substances. For instance, particles of glass were placed on various points of narrow strips of moistened gelatine, and these yielded and became bent with extreme slowness. It is much more difficult to understand how gently moving a particle from one part of a valve to another causes it suddenly to open. To ascertain whether the valves were endowed with irritability, the surfaces of several were scratched with a needle or brushed with a fine camel-hair brush, so as to imitate the crawling movement of small crustaceans, but the valve did not open. Some bladders, before being brushed, were left for a time in water at temperatures between 80° and 130° F. (26°.6-54°.4 Cent.), as, judging from a wide- [page 408] spread analogy, this would have rendered them more sensitive to irritation, or would by itself have excited movement; but no effect was produced. We may, therefore, conclude that animals enter merely by forcing their way through the slit-like orifice; their heads serving as a wedge. But I am surprised that such small and weak creatures as are often captured (for instance, the nauplius of a crustacean, and a tardigrade) should be strong enough to act in this manner, seeing that it was difficult to push in one end of a bit of a hair 1/4 of an inch in length. Nevertheless, it is certain that weak and small creatures do enter, and Mrs. Treat, of New Jersey, has been more successful than any other observer, and has often witnessed in the case of Utricularia clandestina the whole process.* She saw a tardigrade slowly walking round a bladder, as if reconnoitring; at last it crawled into the depression where the valve lies, and then easily entered. She also witnessed the entrapment of various minute crustaceans. Cypris “was quite wary, but nevertheless was often caught. Coming to the entrance of a bladder, it would sometimes pause a moment, and then dash away; at other times it would come close up, and even venture part of the way into the entrance and back out as if afraid. Another, more heedless, would open the door and walk in; but it was no sooner in than it manifested alarm, drew in its feet and antennæ, and closed its shell.” Larvæ, apparently of gnats, when “feeding near the entrance, are pretty certain to run their heads into the net, whence there is no retreat. A large larva is sometimes three or four hours in being swallowed, the process bringing to * ‘New York Tribune,’ reprinted in the ‘Gard. Chron.’ 1875, p. 303. [page 409] mind what I have witnessed when a small snake makes a large frog its victim.” But as the valve does not appear to be in the least irritable, the slow swallowing process must be the effect of the onward movement of the larva. It is difficult to conjecture what can attract so many creatures, animal- and vegetable-feeding crustaceans, worms, tardigrades, and various larvæ, to enter the bladders. Mrs. Treat says that the larvæ just referred to are vegetable-feeders, and seem to have a special liking for the long bristles round the valve, but this taste will not account for the entrance of animal-feeding crustaceans. Perhaps small aquatic animals habitually try to enter every small crevice, like that between the valve and collar, in search of food or protection. It is not probable that the remarkable transparency of the valve is an accidental circumstance, and the spot of light thus formed may serve as a guide. The long bristles round the entrance apparently serve for the same purpose. I believe that this is the case, because the bladders of some epiphytic and marsh species of Utricularia which live embedded either in entangled vegetation or in mud, have no bristles round the entrance, and these under such conditions would be of no service as a guide. Nevertheless, with these epiphytic and marsh species, two pairs of bristles project from the surface of the valve, as in the aquatic species; and their use probably is to prevent too large animals from trying to force an entrance into the bladder, thus rupturing orifice. As under favourable circumstances most of the bladders succeed in securing prey, in one case as many as ten crustaceans;—as the valve is so well fitted to [page 410] allow animals to enter and to prevent their escape;—and as the inside of the bladder presents so singular a structure, clothed with innumerable quadrifid and bifid processes, it is impossible to doubt that the plant has been specially adapted for securing prey. From the analogy of Pinguicula, belonging to the same family, I naturally expected that the bladders would have digested their prey; but this is not the case, and there are no glands fitted for secreting the proper fluid. Nevertheless, in order to test their power of digestion, minute fragments of roast meat, three small cubes of albumen, and three of cartilage, were pushed through the orifice into the bladders of vigorous plants. They were left from one day to three days and a half within, and the bladders were then cut open; but none of the above substances exhibited the least signs of digestion or dissolution; the angles of the cubes being as sharp as ever. These observations were made subsequently to those on Drosera, Dionaea, Drosophyllum, and Pinguicula; so that I was familiar with the appearance of these substances when undergoing the early and final stages of digestion. We may therefore conclude that Utricularia cannot digest the animals which it habitually captures. In most of the bladders the captured animals are so much decayed that they form a pale brown, pulpy mass, with their chitinous coats so tender that they fall to pieces with the greatest ease. The black pigment of the eye-spots is preserved better than anything else. Limbs, jaws, &c. are often found quite detached; and this I suppose is the result of the vain struggles of the later captured animals. I have sometimes felt surprised at the small proportion of imprisoned animals in a fresh state compared with those utterly decayed. Mrs. Treat states with respect [page 411] to the larvæ above referred to, that “usually in less than two days after a large one was captured the fluid contents of the bladders began to assume a cloudy or muddy appearance, and often became so dense that the outline of the animal was lost to view.” This statement raises the suspicion that the bladders secrete some ferment hastening the process of decay. There is no inherent improbability in this supposition, considering that meat soaked for ten minutes in water mingled with the milky juice of the papaw becomes quite tender and soon passes, as Browne remarks in his ‘Natural History of Jamaica,’ into a state of putridity. Whether or not the decay of the imprisoned animals is an any way hastened, it is certain that matter is absorbed from them by the quadrifid and bifid processes. The extremely delicate nature of the membrane of which these processes are formed, and the large surface which they expose, owing to their number crowded over the whole interior of the bladder, are circumstances all favouring the process of absorption. Many perfectly clean bladders which had never caught any prey were opened, and nothing could be distinguished with a No. 8 object-glass of Hartnack within the delicate, structureless protoplasmic lining of the arms, excepting in each a single yellowish particle or modified nucleus. Sometimes two or even three such particles were present; but in this case traces of decaying matter could generally be detected. On the other hand, in bladders containing either one large or several small decayed animals, the processes presented a widely different appearance. Six such bladders were carefully examined; one contained an elongated, coiled-up larva; another a single large entomostracan crustacean, and the others from two to five smaller ones, all [page 412] in a decayed state. In these six bladders, a large number of the quadrifid processes contained transparent, often yellowish, more or less confluent, spherical or irregularly shaped, masses of matter. Some of the processes, however, contained only fine granular matter, the particles of which were so small that they could not be defined clearly with No. 8 of Hartnack. The delicate layer of protoplasm lining their walls was in some cases a little shrunk. On three occasions the above small masses of matter were observed and sketched at short intervals of time; and they certainly changed their positions relatively to each other and to the walls of the arms. Separate masses sometimes became confluent, and then again divided. A single little mass would send out a projection, which after a time separated itself. Hence there could be no doubt that these masses consisted of protoplasm. Bearing in mind that many clean bladders were examined with equal care, and that these presented no such appearance, we may confidently believe that the protoplasm in the above cases had been generated by the absorption of nitrogenous matter from the decaying animals. In two or three other bladders, which at first appeared quite clean, on careful search a few processes were found, with their outsides clogged with a little brown matter, showing that some minute animal had been captured and had decayed, and the arms here included a very few more or less spherical and aggregated masses; the processes in other parts of the bladders being empty and transparent. On the other hand, it must be stated that in three bladders containing dead crustaceans, the processes were likewise empty. This fact may be accounted for by the animals not having been sufficiently decayed, or by time enough not having been allowed for the generation of proto- [page 413] plasm, or by its subsequent absorption and transference to other parts of the plant. It will hereafter be seen that in three or four other species of Utricularia the quadrifid processes in contact with decaying animals likewise contained aggregated masses of protoplasm. On the Absorption of certain Fluids by the Quadrifid and Bifid processes.—These experiments were tried to ascertain whether certain fluids, which seemed adapted for the purpose, would produce the same effects on the processes as the absorption of decayed animal matter. Such experiments are, however, troublesome; for it is not sufficient merely to place a branch in the fluid, as the valve shuts so closely that the fluid apparently does not enter soon, if at all. Even when bristles were pushed into the orifices, they were in several cases wrapped so closely round by the thin flexible edge of the valve that the fluid was apparently excluded; so that the experiments tried in this manner are doubtful and not worth giving. The best plan would have been to puncture the bladders, but I did not think of this till too late, excepting in a few cases. In all such trials, however, it cannot be ascertained positively that the bladder, though translucent, does not contain some minute animal in the last stage of decay. Therefore most of my experiments were made by cutting bladders longitudinally into two; the quadrifids were examined with No. 8 of Hartnack, then irrigated, whilst under the covering glass, with a few drops of the fluid under trial, kept in a damp chamber, and re-examined after stated intervals of time with the same power as before. [Four bladders were first tried as a control experiment, in the manner just described, in a solution of one part of gum arabic to 218 of water, and two bladders in a solution of one part of sugar to 437 of water; and in neither case was any [page 414] change perceptible in the quadrifids or bifids after 21 hrs. Four bladders were then treated in the same manner with a solution of one part of nitrate of ammonia to 437 of water, and re-examined after 21 hrs. In two of these the quadrifids now appeared full of very finely granular matter, and their protoplasmic lining or primordial utricle was a little shrunk. In the third bladder, the quadrifids included distinctly visible granules, and the primordial utricle was a little shrunk after only 8 hrs. In the fourth bladder the primordial utricle in most of the processes was here and there thickened into little, irregular, yellowish specks; and from the gradations which could be traced in this and other cases, these specks appear to give rise to the larger free granules contained within some of the processes. Other bladders, which, as far as could be judged, had never caught any prey, were punctured and left in the same solution for 17 hrs.; and their quadrifids now contained very fine granular matter. A bladder was bisected, examined, and irrigated with a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 437 of water. After 8 hrs. 30 m. the quadrifids contained a good many granules, and the primordial utricle was somewhat shrunk; after 23 hrs. the quadrifids and bifids contained many spheres of hyaline matter, and in one arm twenty-four such spheres of moderate size were counted. Two bisected bladders, which had been previously left for 21 hrs. in the solution of gum (one part to 218 of water) without being affected, were irrigated with the solution of carbonate of ammonia; and both had their quadrifids modified in nearly the same manner as just described,—one after only 9 hrs., and the other after 24 hrs. Two bladders which appeared never to have caught any prey were punctured and placed in the solution; the quadrifids of one were examined after 17 hrs., and found slightly opaque; the quadrifids of the other, examined after 45 hrs., had their primordial utricles more or less shrunk with thickened yellowish specks, like those due to the action of nitrate of ammonia. Several uninjured bladders were left in the same solution, as well as a weaker solution of one part to 1750 of water, or 1 gr. to 4 oz.; and after two days the quadrifids were more or less opaque, with their contents finely granular; but whether the solution had entered by the orifice, or had been absorbed from the outside, I know not. Two bisected bladders were irrigated with a solution of one part of urea to 218 of water; but when this solution was employed, I forgot that it had been kept for some days in a warm room, and had therefore probably generated ammonia; anyhow [page 415] the quadrifids were affected after 21 hrs. as if a solution of carbonate of ammonia had been used; for the primordial utricle was thickened in specks, which seemed to graduate into separate granules. Three bisected bladders were also irrigated with a fresh solution of urea of the same strength; their quadrifids after 21 hrs. were much less affected than in the former case; nevertheless, the primordial utricle in some of the arms was a little shrunk, and in others was divided into two almost symmetrical sacks. Three bisected bladders, after being examined, were irrigated with a putrid and very offensive infusion of raw meat. After 23 hrs. the quadrifids and bifids in all three specimens abounded with minute, hyaline, spherical masses; and some of their primordial utricles were a little shrunk. Three bisected bladders were also irrigated with a fresh infusion of raw meat; and to my surprise the quadrifids in one of them appeared, after 23 hrs., finely granular, with their primordial utricles somewhat shrunk and marked with thickened yellowish specks; so that they had been acted on in the same manner as by the putrid infusion or by the salts of ammonia. In the second bladder some of the quadrifids were similarly acted on, though to a very slight degree; whilst the third bladder was not at all affected.] From these experiments it is clear that the quadrifid and bifid processes have the power of absorbing carbonate and nitrate of ammonia, and matter of some kind from a putrid infusion of meat. Salts of ammonia were selected for trial, as they are known to be rapidly generated by the decay of animal matter in the presence of air and water, and would therefore be generated within the bladders containing captured prey. The effect produced on the processes by these salts and by a putrid infusion of raw meat differs from that produced by the decay of the naturally captured animals only in the aggregated masses of protoplasm being in the latter case of larger size; but it is probable that the fine granules and small hyaline spheres produced by the solutions would coalesce into larger masses, with time enough allowed. [page 416] We have seen with Drosera that the first effect of a weak solution of carbonate of ammonia on the cell-contents is the production of the finest granules, which afterwards aggregate into larger, more or less rounded, masses; and that the granules in the layer of protoplasm which flows round the walls ultimately coalesce with these masses. Changes of this nature are, however, far more rapid in Drosera than in Utricularia. Since the bladders have no power of digesting albumen, cartilage, or roast meat, I was surprised that matter was absorbed, at least in one case, from a fresh infusion of raw meat. I was also surprised, from what we shall presently see with respect to the glands round the orifice, that a fresh solution of urea produced only a moderate effect on the quadrifids. As the quadrifids are developed from papillae which at first closely resemble those on the outside of the bladders and on the surfaces of the leaves, I may here state that the two hemispherical cells with which these latter papillae are crowned, and which in their natural state are perfectly transparent, likewise absorb carbonate and nitrate of ammonia; for, after an immersion of 23 hrs. in solutions of one part of both these salts to 437 of water, their primordial utricles were a little shrunk and of a pale brown tint, and sometimes finely granular. The same result followed from the immersion of a whole branch for nearly three days in a solution of one part of the carbonate to 1750 of water. The grains of chlorophyll, also, in the cells of the leaves on this branch became in many places aggregated into little green masses, which were often connected together by the finest threads. On the Absorption of certain Fluids by the Glands on the Valve and Collar.—The glands round the orifices of bladders which are still young, or which have been [page 417] long kept in moderately pure water, are colourless; and their primordial utricles are only slightly or hardly at all granular. But in the greater number of plants in a state of nature—and we must remember that they generally grow in very foul water—and with plants kept in an aquarium in foul water, most of the glands were of a pale brownish tint; their primordial utricles were more or less shrunk, sometimes ruptured, with their contents often coarsely granular or aggregated into little masses. That this state of the glands is due to their having absorbed matter from the surrounding water, I cannot doubt; for, as we shall immediately see, nearly the same results follow from their immersion for a few hours in various solutions. Nor is it probable that this absorption is useless, seeing that it is almost universal with plants growing in a state of nature, excepting when the water is remarkably pure. The pedicels of the glands which are situated close to the slit-like orifice, both those on the valve and on the collar, are short; whereas the pedicels of the more distant glands are much elongated and project inwards. The glands are thus well placed so to be washed by any fluid coming out of the bladder through the orifice. The valve fits so closely, judging from the result of immersing uninjured bladders in various solutions, that it is doubtful whether any putrid fluid habitually passes outwards. But we must remember that a bladder generally captures several animals; and that each time a fresh animal enters, a puff of foul water must pass out and bathe the glands. Moreover, I have repeatedly found that, by gently pressing bladders which contained air, minute bubbles were driven out through the orifice; and if a bladder is laid on blotting paper and gently pressed, water oozes out. [page 418] In this latter case, as soon as the pressure is relaxed, air is drawn in, and the bladder recovers its proper form. If it is now placed under water and again gently pressed, minute bubbles issue from the orifice and nowhere else, showing that the walls of the bladder have not been ruptured. I mention this because Cohn quotes a statement by Treviranus, that air cannot be forced out of a bladder without rupturing it. We may therefore conclude that whenever air is secreted within a bladder already full of water, some water will be slowly driven out through the orifice. Hence I can hardly doubt that the numerous glands crowded round the orifice are adapted to absorb matter from the putrid water, which will occasionally escape from bladders including decayed animals. [In order to test this conclusion, I experimented with various solutions on the glands. As in the case of the quadrifids, salts of ammonia were tried, since these are generated by the final decay of animal matter under water. Unfortunately the glands cannot be carefully examined whilst attached to the bladders in their entire state. Their summits, therefore, including the valve, collar, and antennæ, were sliced off, and the condition of the glands observed; they were then irrigated, whilst beneath a covering glass, with the solutions, and after a time re-examined with the same power as before, namely No. 8 of Hartnack. The following experiments were thus made. As a control experiment solutions of one part of white sugar and of one part of gum to 218 of water were first used, to see whether these produced any change in the glands. It was also necessary to observe whether the glands were affected by the summits of the bladders having been cut off. The summits of four were thus tried; one being examined after 2 hrs. 30 m., and the other three after 23 hrs.; but there was no marked change in the glands of any of them. Two summits bearing quite colourless glands were irrigated with a solution of carbonate of ammonia of the same strength (viz. one part to 218 of water) , and in 5 m. the primordial utricles of most of the glands were somewhat contracted; they were also thickened in specks or patches, and had assumed a pale [page 419] brown tint. When looked at again after 1 hr. 30 m., most of them presented a somewhat different appearance. A third specimen was treated with a weaker solution of one part of the carbonate to 437 of water, and after 1 hr. the glands were pale brown and contained numerous granules. Four summits were irrigated with a solution of one part of nitrate of ammonia to 437 of water. One was examined after 15 m., and the glands seemed affected; after 1 hr. 10 m. there was a greater change, and the primordial utricles in most of them were somewhat shrunk, and included many granules. In the second specimen, the primordial utricles were considerably shrunk and brownish after 2 hrs. Similar effects were observed in the two other specimens, but these were not examined until 21 hrs. had elapsed. The nuclei of many of the glands apparently had increased in size. Five bladders on a branch, which had been kept for a long time in moderately pure water, were cut off and examined, and their glands found very little modified. The remainder of this branch was placed in the solution of the nitrate, and after 21 hrs. two bladders were examined, and all their glands were brownish, with their primordial utricles somewhat shrunk and finely granular. The summit of another bladder, the glands of which were in a beautifully clear condition, was irrigated with a few drops of a mixed solution of nitrate and phosphate of ammonia, each of one part to 437 of water. After 2 hrs. some few of the glands were brownish. After 8 hrs. almost all the oblong glands were brown and much more opaque than they were before; their primordial utricles were somewhat shrunk and contained a little aggregated granular matter. The spherical glands were still white, but their utricles were broken up into three or four small hyaline spheres, with an irregularly contracted mass in the middle of the basal part. These smaller spheres changed their forms in the course of a few hours and some of them disappeared. By the next morning, after 23 hrs. 30 m., they had all disappeared, and the glands were brown; their utricles now formed a globular shrunken mass in the middle. The utricles of the oblong glands had shrunk very little, but their contents were somewhat aggregated. Lastly, the summit of a bladder which had been previously irrigated for 21 hrs. with a solution of one part of sugar to 218 of water without being affected, was treated with the above mixed solution; and after 8 hrs. 30 m. all the glands became brown, with their primordial utricles slightly shrunk. Four summits were irrigated with a putrid infusion of raw [page 420] meat. No change in the glands was observable for some hours, but after 24 hrs. most of them had become brownish, and more opaque and granular than they were before. In these specimens, as in those irrigated with the salts of ammonia, the nuclei seemed to have increased both in size and solidity, but they were not measured. Five summits were also irrigated with a fresh infusion of raw meat; three of these were not at all affected in 24 hrs., but the glands of the other two had perhaps become more granular. One of the specimens which was not affected was then irrigated with the mixed solution of the nitrate and phosphate of ammonia, and after only 25 m. the glands contained from four or five to a dozen granules. After six additional hours their primordial utricles were greatly shrunk. The summit of a bladder was examined, and all the glands found colourless, with their primordial utricles not at all shrunk; yet many of the oblong glands contained granules just resolvable with No. 8 of Hartnack. It was then irrigated with a few drops of a solution of one part of urea to 218 of water. After 2 hrs. 25 m. the spherical glands were still colourless; whilst the oblong and two-armed ones were of a brownish tint, and their primordial utricles much shrunk, some containing distinctly visible granules. After 9 hrs. some of the spherical glands were brownish, and the oblong glands were still more changed, but they contained fewer separate granules; their nuclei, on the other hand, appeared larger, as if they had absorbed the granules. After 23 hrs. all the glands were brown, their primordial utricles greatly shrunk, and in many cases ruptured. A bladder was now experimented on, which was already somewhat affected by the surrounding water; for the spherical glands, though colourless, had their primordial utricles slightly shrunk; and the oblong glands were brownish, with their utricles much, but irregularly, shrunk. The summit was treated with the solution of urea, but was little affected by it in 9 hrs.; nevertheless, after 23 hrs. the spherical glands were brown, with their utricles more shrunk; several of the other glands were still browner, with their utricles contracted into irregular little masses. Two other summits, with their glands colourless and their utricles not shrunk, were treated with the same solution of urea. After 5 hrs. many of the glands presented a shade of brown, with their utricles slightly shrunk. After 20 hrs. 40 m. some few of them were quite brown, and contained [page 421] irregularly aggregated masses; others were still colourless, though their utricles were shrunk; but the greater number were not much affected. This was a good instance of how unequally the glands on the same bladder are sometimes affected, as likewise often occurs with plants growing in foul water. Two other summits were treated with a solution which had been kept during several days in a warm room, and their glands were not at all affected when examined after 21 hrs. A weaker solution of one part of urea to 437 of water was next tried on six summits, all carefully examined before being irrigated. The first was re-examined after 8 hrs. 30 m., and the glands, including the spherical ones, were brown; many of the oblong glands having their primordial utricles much shrunk and including granules. The second summit, before being irrigated, had been somewhat affected by the surrounding water, for the spherical glands were not quite uniform in appearance; and a few of the oblong ones were brown, with their utricles shrunk. Of the oblong glands, those which were before colourless, became brown in 3 hrs. 12 m. after irrigation, with their utricles slightly shrunk. The spherical glands did not become brown, but their contents seemed changed in appearance, and after 23 hrs. still more changed and granular. Most of the oblong glands were now dark brown, but their utricles were not greatly shrunk. The four other specimens were examined after 3 hrs. 30 m., after 4 hrs., and 9 hrs.; a brief account of their condition will be sufficient. The spherical glands were not brown, but some of them were finely granular. Many of the oblong glands were brown, and these, as well as others which still remained colourless, had their utricles more or less shrunk, some of them including small aggregated masses of matter.] A Summary of the Observations on Absorption.—From the facts now given there can be no doubt that the variously shaped glands on the valve and round the collar have the power of absorbing matter from weak solutions of certain salts of ammonia and urea, and from a putrid infusion of raw meat. Prof. Cohn believes that they secrete slimy matter; but I was not able to perceive any trace of such action, excepting that, after immersion in alcohol, extremely fine lines could sometimes be seen radiating from their [page 422] surfaces. The glands are variously affected by absorption; they often become of a brown colour; sometimes they contain very fine granules, or moderately sized grains, or irregularly aggregated little masses; sometimes the nuclei appear to have increased in size; the primordial utricles are generally more or less shrunk and sometimes ruptured. Exactly the same changes may be observed in the glands of plants growing and flourishing in foul water. The spherical glands are generally affected rather differently from the oblong and two-armed ones. The former do not so commonly become brown, and are acted on more slowly. We may therefore infer that they differ somewhat in their natural functions. It is remarkable how unequally the glands on the bladders on the same branch, and even the glands of the same kind on the same bladder, are affected by the foul water in which the plants have grown, and by the solutions which were employed. In the former case I presume that this is due either to little currents bringing matter to some glands and not to others, or to unknown differences in their constitution. When the glands on the same bladder are differently affected by a solution, we may suspect that some of them had previously absorbed a small amount of matter from the water. However this may be, we have seen that the glands on the same leaf of Drosera are sometimes very unequally affected, more especially when exposed to certain vapours. If glands which have already become brown, with their primordial utricles shrunk, are irrigated with one of the effective solutions, they are not acted on, or only slightly and slowly. If, however, a gland contains merely a few coarse granules, this does not prevent a solution from acting. I have never seen [page 423] any appearance making it probable that glands which have been strongly affected by absorbing matter of any kind are capable of recovering their pristine, colourless, and homogeneous condition, and of regaining the power of absorbing. From the nature of the solutions which were tried, I presume that nitrogen is absorbed by the glands; but the modified, brownish, more or less shrunk, and aggregated contents of the oblong glands were never seen by me or by my son to undergo those spontaneous changes of form characteristic of protoplasm. On the other hand, the contents of the larger spherical glands often separated into small hyaline globules or irregularly shaped masses, which changed their forms very slowly and ultimately coalesced, forming a central shrunken mass. Whatever may be the nature of the contents of the several kinds of glands, after they have been acted on by foul water or by one of the nitrogenous solutions, it is probable that the matter thus generated is of service to the plant, and is ultimately transferred to other parts. The glands apparently absorb more quickly than do the quadrifid and bifid processes; and on the view above maintained, namely that they absorb matter from putrid water occasionally emitted from the bladders, they ought to act more quickly than the processes; as these latter remain in permanent contact with captured and decaying animals. Finally, the conclusion to which we are led by the foregoing experiments and observations is that the bladders have no power of digesting animal matter, though it appears that the quadrifids are somewhat affected by a fresh infusion of raw meat. It is certain that the processes within the bladders, and the glands outside, absorb matter from salts of [page 424] ammonia, from a putrid infusion of raw meat, and from urea. The glands apparently are acted on more strongly by a solution of urea, and less strongly by an infusion of raw meat, than are the processes. The case of urea is particularly interesting, because we have seen that it produces no effect on Drosera, the leaves of which are adapted to digest fresh animal matter. But the most important fact of all is, that in the present and following species the quadrifid and bifid processes of bladders containing decayed animals generally include little masses of spontaneously moving protoplasm; whilst such masses are never seen in perfectly clean bladders. Development of the Bladders.—My son and I spent much time over this subject with small success. Our observations apply to the present species and to Utricularia vulgaris, but were made chiefly on the latter, as the bladders are twice as large as those of Utricularia neglecta. In the early part of autumn the stems terminate in large buds, which fall off and lie dormant during the winter at the bottom. The young leaves forming these buds bear bladders in various stages of early development. When the bladders of Utricularia vulgaris are about 1/100 inch (.254 mm.) in diameter (or 1/200 in the case of Utricularia neglecta), they are circular in outline, with a narrow, almost closed, transverse orifice, leading into a hollow filled with water; but the bladders are hollow when much under 1/100 of an inch in diameter. The orifices face inwards or towards the axis of the plant. At this early age the bladders are flattened in the plane in which the orifice lies, and therefore at right angles to that of the mature bladders. They are covered exteriorly with papillae of different sizes, many of which have an elliptical outline. A bundle of vessels, formed of [page 425] simple elongated cells, runs up the short footstalk, and divides at the base of the bladder. One branch extends up the middle of the dorsal surface, and the other up the middle of the ventral surface. In full-grown bladders the ventral bundle divides close beneath the collar, and the two branches run on each side to near where the corners of the valve unite with the collar; but these branches could not be seen in very young bladders. FIG. 23. (Utricularia vulgaris.) Longitudinal section through a young bladder, 1/100 of an inch in length, with the orifice too widely open. The accompanying figure (fig. 23) shows a section, which happened to be strictly medial, through the footstalk and between the nascent antennæ of a bladder of Utricularia vulgaris, 1/100 inch in diameter. The specimen was soft, and the young valve became separated from the collar to a greater degree than is natural, and is thus represented. We here clearly see that the valve and collar are infolded prolongations of the walls of the bladder. Even at this early age, glands could be detected on the valve. The state of the quadrifid processes will presently be described. The antennæ at this period consist of minute cellular projections (not shown in the above figure, as they do not lie in the medial plane), which soon bear incipient bristles. In five instances the young antennæ were not of quite equal length; and this fact is intelligible if I am right in believing that they represent two divisions of the leaf, rising from the end of the bladder; for, with the true leaves, whilst very young, the divisions are never, as far as I have seen, strictly opposite; they [page 426] must therefore be developed one after the other, and so it would be with the two antennæ. At a much earlier age, when the half formed bladders are only 1/300 inch (.0846 mm.) in diameter or a little more, they present a totally different appearance. One is represented on the left side of the accompanying drawing (fig. 24). The young leaves FIG. 24. (Utricularia vulgaris.) Young leaf from a winter bud, showing on the left side a bladder in its earliest stage of development. at this age have broad flattened segments, with their future divisions represented by prominences, one of which is shown on the right side. Now, in a large number of specimens examined by my son, the young bladders appeared as if formed by the oblique folding over of the apex and of one margin with a prominence, against the opposite margin. The circular hollow between the infolded apex and infolded prominence apparently contracts into the narrow orifice, wherein the valve and collar will be developed; the bladder itself being formed by the confluence of the opposed [page 427] margins of the rest of the leaf. But strong objections may be urged against this view, for we must in this case suppose that the valve and collar are developed asymmetrically from the sides of the apex and prominence. Moreover, the bundles of vascular tissue have to be formed in lines quite irrespective of the original form of the leaf. Until gradations can be shown to exist between this the earliest state and a young yet perfect bladder, the case must be left doubtful. As the quadrifid and bifid processes offer one of the greatest peculiarities in the genus, I carefully observed their development in Utricularia neglecta. In bladders about 1/100 of an inch in diameter, the inner surface is studded with papillae, rising from small cells at the junctions of the larger ones. These papillae consist of a delicate conical protuberance, which narrows into a very short footstalk, surmounted by two minute cells. They thus occupy the same relative position, and closely resemble, except in being smaller and rather more prominent, the papillae on the outside of the bladders, and on the surfaces of the leaves. The two terminal cells of the papillae first become much elongated in a line parallel to the inner surface of the bladder. Next, each is divided by a longitudinal partition. Soon the two half-cells thus formed separate from one another; and we now have four cells or an incipient quadrifid process. As there is not space for the two new cells to increase in breadth in their original plane, the one slides partly under the other. Their manner of growth now changes, and their outer sides, instead of their apices, continue to grow. The two lower cells, which have slid partly beneath the two upper ones, form the longer and more upright pair of processes; whilst the two upper cells form the shorter [page 428] and more horizontal pair; the four together forming a perfect quadrifid. A trace of the primary division between the two cells on the summits of the papillae can still be seen between the bases of the longer processes. The development of the quadrifids is very liable to be arrested. I have seen a bladder 1/50 of an inch in length including only primordial papillae; and another bladder, about half its full size, with the quadrifids in an early stage of development. As far as I could make out, the bifid processes are developed in the same manner as the quadrifids, excepting that the two primary terminal cells never become divided, and only increase in length. The glands on the valve and collar appear at so early an age that I could not trace their development; but we may reasonably suspect that they are developed from papillae like those on the outside of the bladder, but with their terminal cells not divided into two. The two segments forming the pedicels of the glands probably answer to the conical protuberance and short footstalk of the quadrifid and bifid processes. I am strengthened in the belief that the glands are developed from papillae like those on the outside of the bladders, from the fact that in Utricularia amethystina the glands extend along the whole ventral surface of the bladder close to the footstalk. UTRICULARIA VULGARIS. Living plants from Yorkshire were sent me by Dr. Hooker. This species differs from the last in the stems and leaves being thicker or coarser; their divisions form a more acute angle with one another; the notches on the leaves bear three or four short bristles instead of one; and the bladders are twice as large, or about 1/5 of an inch (5.08 mm.) in diameter. In all essential respects the bladders resemble those of Utricularia neglecta, but the sides of the peristome are perhaps a little more [page 429] prominent, and always bear, as far as I have seen, seven or eight long multicellular bristles. There are eleven long bristles on each antenna, the terminal pair being included. Five bladders, containing prey of some kind, were examined. The first included five Cypris; a large copepod and a Diaptomus; the second, four Cypris; the third, a single rather large crustacean; the fourth, six crustaceans; and the fifth, ten. My son examined the quadrifid processes in a bladder containing the remains of two crustaceans, and found some of them full of spherical or irregularly shaped masses of matter, which were observed to move and to coalesce. These masses therefore consisted of protoplasm. UTRICULARIA MINOR. FIG. 25. (Utricularia minor.) Quadrifid process, greatly enlarged. This rare species was sent me in a living state from Cheshire, through the kindness of Mr. John Price. The leaves and bladders are much smaller than those of Utricularia neglecta. The leaves bear fewer and shorter bristles, and the bladders are more globular. The antennæ, instead of projecting in front of the bladders, are curled under the valve, and are armed with twelve or fourteen extremely long multicellular bristles, generally arranged in pairs. These, with seven or eight long bristles on both sides of the peristome, form a sort of net over the valve, which would tend to prevent all animals, excepting very small ones, entering the bladder. The valve and collar have the same essential structure as in the two previous species; but the glands are not quite so numerous; the oblong ones are rather more elongated, whilst the two-armed ones are rather less elongated. The four bristles which project obliquely from the lower edge of the valve are short. Their shortness, compared with those on the valves of the foregoing species, is intelligible if my view is correct that they serve to prevent too large animals forcing an entrance through the valve, thus injuring it; for the valve is already protected to a certain extent by the incurved antennæ, together with the lateral bristles. The bifid processes are like those in the previous species; but the quadrifids differ in the four arms (fig. 25) [page 430] being directed to the same side; the two longer ones being central, and the two shorter ones on the outside. The plants were collected in the middle of July; and the contents of five bladders, which from their opacity seemed full of prey, were examined. The first contained no less than twenty-four minute fresh-water crustaceans, most of them consisting of empty shells, or including only a few drops of red oily matter; the second contained twenty; the third, fifteen; the fourth, ten, some of them being rather larger than usual; and the fifth, which seemed stuffed quite full, contained only seven, but five of these were of unusually large size. The prey, therefore, judging from these five bladders, consists exclusively of fresh-water crustaceans, most of which appeared to be distinct species from those found in the bladders of the two former species. In one bladder the quadrifids in contact with a decaying mass contained numerous spheres of granular matter, which slowly changed their forms and positions. UTRICULARIA CLANDESTINA. This North American species, which is aquatic like the three foregoing ones, has been described by Mrs. Treat, of New Jersey, whose excellent observations have already been largely quoted. I have not as yet seen any full description by her of the structure of the bladder, but it appears to be lined with quadrifid processes. A vast number of captured animals were found within the bladders; some being crustaceans, but the greater number delicate, elongated larvæ, I suppose of Culicidae. On some stems, “fully nine out of every ten bladders contained these larvæ or their remains.” The larvæ “showed signs of life from twenty-four to thirty-six hours after being imprisoned,” and then perished.

FIG. 26. (Utricularia montana.) Rhizome swollen into a tuber; the branches bearing minute bladders; of natural size. Utricularia montana.—This species inhabits the tropical parts of South America, and is said to be epiphytic; but, judging from the state of the roots (rhizomes) of some dried specimens from the herbarium at Kew, it likewise lives in earth, probably in crevices of rocks. In English hothouses it is grown in peaty soil. Lady Dorothy Nevill was so kind as to give me a fine plant, and I received another from Dr. Hooker. The leaves are entire, instead of being much divided, as in the foregoing aquatic species. They are elongated, about 1 1/2 inch in breadth, and furnished with a distinct footstalk. The plant produces numerous colourless rhizomes, as thin as threads, which bear minute bladders, and occasionally swell into tubers, as will [page 432] hereafter be described. These rhizomes appear exactly like roots, but occasionally throw up green shoots. They penetrate the earth sometimes to the depth of more than 2 inches; but when the plant grows as an epiphyte, they must creep amidst the mosses, roots, decayed bark, &c., with which the trees of these countries are thickly covered. As the bladders are attached to the rhizomes, they are necessarily subterranean. They are produced in extraordinary numbers. One of my plants, though young, must have borne several hundreds; for a single branch out of an entangled mass had thirty-two, and another branch, about 2 inches in length (but with its end and one side branch broken off), had seventy- three bladders.* The bladders are compressed and rounded, with the ventral surface, or that between the summit of the long delicate footstalk and valve, extremely short (fig. 27). They are colourless and almost as transparent as glass, so that they appear smaller than they really are, the largest being under the 1/20 of an inch (1.27 mm.) in its longer diameter. They are formed of rather large angular cells, at the junctions of which oblong papillae project, corresponding with those on the surfaces of the bladders of the previous species. Similar papillae abound on the rhizomes, and even on the entire leaves, but they are rather broader on the latter. Vessels, marked with parallel bars instead of by a spiral line, run up the footstalks, and * Prof. Oliver has figured a plant of Utricularia Jamesoniana (‘Proc. Linn. Soc.’ vol. iv. p. 169) having entire leaves and rhizomes, like those of our present species; but the margins of the terminal halves of some of the leaves are converted into bladders. This fact clearly indicates that the bladders on the rhizomes of the present and following species are modified segments of the leaf; and they are thus brought into accordance with the bladders attached to the divided and floating leaves of the aquatic species. [page 433] just enter the bases of the bladders; but they do not bifurcate and extend up the dorsal and ventral surfaces, as in the previous species. The antennæ are of moderate length, and taper to a fine point; they differ conspicuously from those before described, in not being armed with bristles. Their bases are so abruptly curved that their tips generally rest one on each side of the middle of the bladder, but FIG. 27. (Utricularia montana.) Bladder; about 27 times enlarged. sometimes near the margin. Their curved bases thus form a roof over the cavity in which the valve lies; but there is always left on each side a little circular passage into the cavity, as may be seen in the drawing, as well as a narrow passage between the bases of the two antennæ. As the bladders are subterranean, had it not been for the roof, the cavity in which the valve lies would have been liable to be blocked up with earth [page 434] and rubbish; so that the curvature of the antennæ is a serviceable character. There are no bristles on the outside of the collar or peristome, as in the foregoing species. The valve is small and steeply inclined, with its free posterior edge abutting against a semicircular, deeply depending collar. It is moderately transparent, and bears two pairs of short stiff bristles, in the same position as in the other species. The presence of these four bristles, in contrast with the absence of those on the antennæ and collar, indicates that they are of functional importance, namely, as I believe, to prevent too large animals forcing an entrance through the valve. The many glands of diverse shapes attached to the valve and round the collar in the previous species are here absent, with the exception of about a dozen of the two-armed or transversely elongated kind, which are seated near the borders of the valve, and are mounted on very short footstalks. These glands are only the 3/4000 of an inch (.019 mm.) in length; though so small, they act as absorbents. The collar is thick, stiff, and almost semi-circular; it is formed of the same peculiar brownish tissue as in the former species. The bladders are filled with water, and sometimes include bubbles of air. They bear internally rather short, thick, quadrifid processes arranged in approximately concentric rows. The two pairs of arms of which they are formed differ only a little in length, and stand in a peculiar position (fig. 28); the two longer ones forming one line, and the two shorter ones another parallel line. Each arm includes a small spherical mass of brownish matter, which, when crushed, breaks into angular pieces. I have no doubt that these spheres are nuclei, for closely similar ones [page 435] are present in the cells forming the walls of the bladders. Bifid processes, having rather short oval arms, arise in the usual position on the inner side of the collar. These bladders, therefore, resemble in all essential respects the larger ones of the foregoing species. They differ chiefly in the absence of the numerous glands on the valve and round the collar, a few minute ones of one kind alone being present on the valve. They differ more conspicuously in the absence of the long bristles on the antennæ and on the outside of the collar. The presence of these bristles in the previously mentioned species probably relates to the capture of aquatic animals. FIG. 28. (Utricularia montana.) One of the quadrifid processes; much enlarged. It seemed to me an interesting question whether the minute bladders of Utricularia montanaserved, as in the previous species, to capture animals living in the earth, or in the dense vegetation covering the trees on which this species is epiphytic; for in this case we should have a new sub-class of carnivorous plants, namely, subterranean feeders. Many bladders, therefore, were examined, with the following results:— [(1) A small bladder, less than 1/30 of an inch (.847 mm.) in diameter, contained a minute mass of brown, much decayed matter; and in this, a tarsus with four or five joints, terminating in a double hook, was clearly distinguished under the microscope. I suspect that it was a remnant of one of the Thysanoura. The quadrifids in contact with this decayed remnant contained either small masses of translucent, yellowish matter, generally more [page 436] or less globular, or fine granules. In distant parts of the same bladder, the processes were transparent and quite empty, with the exception of their solid nuclei. My son made at short intervals of time sketches of one of the above aggregated masses, and found that they continually and completely changed their forms; sometimes separating from one another and again coalescing. Evidently protoplasm had been generated by the absorption of some element from the decaying animal matter. (2) Another bladder included a still smaller speck of decayed brown matter, and the adjoining quadrifids contained aggregated matter, exactly as in the last case. (3) A third bladder included a larger organism, which was so much decayed that I could only make out that it was spinose or hairy. The quadrifids in this case were not much affected, excepting that the nuclei in the several arms differed much in size; some of them containing two masses having a similar appearance. (4) A fourth bladder contained an articulate organism, for I distinctly saw the remnant of a limb, terminating in a hook. The quadrifids were not examined. (5) A fifth included much decayed matter apparently of some animal, but with no recognisable features. The quadrifids in contact contained numerous spheres of protoplasm. (6) Some few bladders on the plant which I received from Kew were examined; and in one, there was a worm-shaped animal very little decayed, with a distinct remnant of a similar one greatly decayed. Several of the arms of the processes in contact with these remains contained two spherical masses, like the single solid nucleus which is properly found in each arm. In another bladder there was a minute grain of quartz, reminding me of two similar cases with Utricularia neglecta. As it appeared probable that this plant would capture a greater number of animals in its native country than under culture, I obtained permission to remove small portions of the rhizomes from dried specimens in the herbarium at Kew. I did not at first find out that it was advisable to soak the rhizomes for two or three days, and that it was necessary to open the bladders and spread out their contents on glass; as from their state of decay and from having been dried and pressed, their nature could not otherwise be well distinguished. Several bladders on a plant which had grown in black earth in New Granada were first examined; and four of these included remnants of animals. The first contained a hairy Acarus, so much decayed that nothing was left except its transparent coat; [page 437] also a yellow chitinous head of some animal with an internal fork, to which the oesophagus was suspended, but I could see no mandibles; also the double hook of the tarsus of some animal; also an elongated greatly decayed animal; and lastly, a curious flask-shaped organism, having the walls formed of rounded cells. Professor Claus has looked at this latter organism, and thinks that it is the shell of a rhizopod, probably one of the Arcellidae. In this bladder, as well as in several others, there were some unicellular Algae, and one multicellular Alga, which no doubt had lived as intruders. A second bladder contained an Acarus much less decayed than the former one, with its eight legs preserved; as well as remnants of several other articulate animals. A third bladder contained the end of the abdomen with the two hinder limbs of an Acarus, as I believe. A fourth contained remnants of a distinctly articulated bristly animal, and of several other organisms, as well as much dark brown organic matter, the nature of which could not be made out. Some bladders from a plant, which had lived as an epiphyte in Trinidad, in the West Indies, were next examined, but not so carefully as the others; nor had they been soaked long enough. Four of them contained much brown, translucent, granular matter, apparently organic, but with no distinguishable parts. The quadrifids in two were brownish, with their contents granular; and it was evident that they had absorbed matter. In a fifth bladder there was a flask-shaped organism, like that above mentioned. A sixth contained a very long, much decayed, worm-shaped animal. Lastly, a seventh bladder contained an organism, but of what nature could not be distinguished.] Only one experiment was tried on the quadrifid processes and glands with reference to their power of absorption. A bladder was punctured and left for 24 hrs. in a solution of one part of urea to 437 of water, and the quadrifid and bifid processes were found much affected. In some arms there was only a single symmetrical globular mass, larger than the proper nucleus, and consisting of yellowish matter, generally translucent but sometimes granular; in others there were two masses of different sizes, one large and the [page 438] other small; and in others there were irregularly shaped globules; so that it appeared as if the limpid contents of the processes, owing to the absorption of matter from the solution, had become aggregated sometimes round the nucleus, and sometimes into separate masses; and that these then tended to coalesce. The primordial utricle or protoplasm lining the processes was also thickened here and there into irregular and variously shaped specks of yellowish translucent matter, as occurred in the case of Utricularia neglecta under similar treatment. These specks apparently did not change their forms. The minute two-armed glands on the valve were also affected by the solution; for they now contained several, sometimes as many as six or eight, almost spherical masses of translucent matter, tinged with yellow, which slowly changed their forms and positions. Such masses were never observed in these glands in their ordinary state. We may therefore infer that they serve for absorption. Whenever a little water is expelled from a bladder containing animal remains (by the means formerly specified, more especially by the generation of bubbles of air), it will fill the cavity in which the valve lies; and thus the glands will be able to utilise decayed matter which otherwise would have been wasted. Finally, as numerous minute animals are captured by this plant in its native country and when cultivated, there can be no doubt that the bladders, though so small, are far from being in a rudimentary condition; on the contrary, they are highly efficient traps. Nor can there be any doubt that matter is absorbed from the decayed prey by the quadrifid and bifid processes, and that protoplasm is thus generated. What tempts animals of such diverse kinds to enter [page 439] the cavity beneath the bowed antennæ, and then force their way through the little slit-like orifice between the valve and collar into the bladders filled with water, I cannot conjecture. Tubers.—These organs, one of which is represented in a previous figure (fig. 26) of the natural size, deserve a few remarks. Twenty were found on the rhizomes of a single plant, but they cannot be strictly counted; for, besides the twenty, there were all possible gradations between a short length of a rhizome just perceptibly swollen and one so much swollen that it might be doubtfully called a tuber. When well developed, they are oval and symmetrical, more so than appears in the figure. The largest which I saw was 1 inch (25.4 mm.) in length and .45 inch (11.43 mm.) in breadth. They commonly lie near the surface, but some are buried at the depth of 2 inches. The buried ones are dirty white, but those partly exposed to the light become greenish from the development, of chlorophyll in their superficial cells. They terminate in a rhizome, but this sometimes decays and drops off . They do not contain any air, and they sink in water; their surfaces are covered with the usual papillae. The bundle of vessels which runs up each rhizome, as soon as it enters the tuber, separates into three distinct bundles, which reunite at the opposite end. A rather thick slice of a tuber is almost as translucent as glass, and is seen to consist of large angular cells, full of water and not containing starch or any other solid matter. Some slices were left in alcohol for several days, but only a few extremely minute granules of matter were precipitated on the walls of the cells; and these were much smaller and fewer than those precipitated on the cell-walls of the rhizomes and bladders. We may therefore con- [page 440] clude that the tuber do not serve as reservoirs for food, but for water during the dry season to which the plant is probably exposed. The many little bladders filled with water would aid towards the same end. To test the correctness of this view, a small plant, growing in light peaty earth in a pot (only 4 1/2 by 4 1/2 inches outside measure) was copiously watered, and then kept without a drop of water in the hothouse. Two of the upper tubers were beforehand uncovered and measured, and then loosely covered up again. In a fortnight’s time the earth in the pot appeared extremely dry; but not until the thirty-fifth day were the leaves in the least affected; they then became slightly reflexed, though still soft and green. This plant, which bore only ten tubers, would no doubt have resisted the drought for even a longer time, had I not previously removed three of the tubers and cut off several long rhizomes. When, on the thirty-fifth day, the earth in the pot was turned out, it appeared as dry as the dust on a road. All the tubers had their surfaces much wrinkled, instead of being smooth and tense. They had all shrunk, but I cannot say accurately how much; for as they were at first symmetrically oval, I measured only their length and thickness; but they contracted in a transverse line much more in one direction than in another, so as to become greatly flattened. One of the two tubers which had been measured was now three-fourths of its original length, and two-thirds of its original thickness in the direction in which it had been measured, but in another direction only one- third of its former thickness. The other tuber was one-fourth shorter, one-eighth less thick in the direction in which it had been measured, and only half as thick in another direction. A slice was cut from one of these shrivelled tubers [page 441] and examined. The cells still contained much water and no air, but they were more rounded or less angular than before, and their walls not nearly so straight; it was therefore clear that the cells had contracted. The tubers, as long as they remain alive, have a strong attraction for water; the shrivelled one, from which a slice had been cut, was left in water for 22 hrs. 30 m., and its surface became as smooth and tense as it originally was. On the other hand, a shrivelled tuber, which by some accident had been separated from its rhizome, and which appeared dead, did not swell in the least, though left for several days in water. With many kinds of plants, tubers, bulbs, &c. no doubt serve in part as reservoirs for water, but I know of no case, besides the present one, of such organs having been developed solely for this purpose. Prof. Oliver informs me that two or three species of Utricularia are provided with these appendages; and the group containing them has in consequence received the name of orchidioides. All the other species of Utricularia, as well as of certain closely related genera, are either aquatic or marsh plants; therefore, on the principle of nearly allied plants generally having a similar constitution, a never failing supply of water would probably be of great importance to our present species. We can thus understand the meaning of the development of its tubers, and of their number on the same plant, amounting in one instance to at least twenty. UTRICULARIA NELUMBIFOLIA, AMETHYSTINA, GRIFFITHII, CAERULEA, ORBICULATA, MULTICAULIS. As I wished to ascertain whether the bladders on the rhizomes of other species of Utricularia, and of the [page 442] species of certain closely allied genera, had the same essential structure as those of Utricularia montana, and whether they captured prey, I asked Prof. Oliver to send me fragments from the herbarium at Kew. He kindly selected some of the most distinct forms, having entire leaves, and believed to inhabit marshy ground or water. My son Francis Darwin, examined them, and has given me the following observations; but it should be borne in mind that it is extremely difficult to make out the structure of such minute and delicate objects after they have been dried and pressed.* Utricularia nelumbifolia (Organ Mountains, Brazil).—The habitat of this species is remarkable. According to its discoverer, Mr. Gardner,** it is aquatic, but “is only to be found growing in the water which collects in the bottom of the leaves of a large Tillandsia, that inhabits abundantly an arid rocky part of the mountain, at an elevation of about 5000 feet above the level of the sea. Besides the ordinary method by seed, it propagates itself by runners, which it throws out from the base of the flower-stem; this runner is always found directing itself towards the nearest Tillandsia, when it inserts its point into the water and gives origin to a new plant, which in its turn sends out another shoot. In this manner I have seen not less than six plants united.” The bladders resemble those of Utricularia montana in all essential respects, even to the presence of a few minute two-armed glands on the valve. Within one bladder there was the remnant of the abdomen of some larva or crustacean of large size, * Prof. Oliver has given (‘Proc. Linn. Soc.’ vol. iv. p. 169) figures of the bladders of two South American species, namely Utricularia Jamesoniana and peltata; but he does not appear to have paid particular attention to these organs. ** ‘Travels in the Interior of Brazil, 1836-41,’ p. 527. [page 443] having a brush of long sharp bristles at the apex. Other bladders included fragments of articulate animals, and many of them contained broken pieces of a curious organism, the nature of which was not recognised by anyone to whom it was shown. Utricularia amethystina (Guiana).—This species has small entire leaves, and is apparently a marsh plant; but it must grow in places where crustaceans exist, for there were two small species within one of the bladders. The bladders are nearly of the same shape as those of Utricularia montana, and are covered outside with the usual papillae; but they differ remarkably in the antennæ being reduced to two short points, united by a membrane hollowed out in the middle. This membrane is covered with innumerable oblong glands supported on long footstalks; most of which are arranged in two rows converging towards the valve. Some, however, are seated on the margins of the membrane; and the short ventral surface of the bladder, between the petiole and valve, is thickly covered with glands. Most of the heads had fallen off, and the footstalks alone remained; so that the ventral surface and the orifice, when viewed under a weak power, appeared as if clothed with fine bristles. The valve is narrow, and bears a few almost sessile glands. The collar against which the edge shuts is yellowish, and presents the usual structure. From the large number of glands on the ventral surface and round the orifice, it is probable that this species lives in very foul water, from which it absorbs matter, as well as from its captured and decaying prey. Utricularia griffithii (Malay and Borneo).—The bladders are transparent and minute; one which was measured being only 28/1000 of an inch (.711 mm.) in diameter. The antennæ are of moderate length, and [page 444] project straight forward; they are united for a short space at their bases by a membrane; and they bear a moderate number of bristles or hairs, not simple as heretofore, but surmounted by glands. The bladders also differ remarkably from those of the previous species, as within there are no quadrifid, only bifid, processes. In one bladder there was a minute aquatic larva; in another the remains of some articulate animal; and in most of them grains of sand. Utricularia caerulea (India).—The bladders resemble those of the last species, both in the general character of the antennæ and in the processes within being exclusively bifid. They contained remnants of entomostracan crustaceans. Utricularia orbiculata (India).—The orbicular leaves and the stems bearing the bladders apparently float in water. The bladders do not differ much from those of the two last species. The antennæ, which are united for a short distance at their bases, bear on their outer surfaces and summits numerous, long, multicellular hairs, surmounted by glands. The processes within the bladders are quadrifid, with the four diverging arms of equal length. The prey which they had captured consisted of entomostracan crustaceans. Utricularia multicaulis (Sikkim, India, 7000 to 11,000 feet).—The bladders, attached to rhizomes, are remarkable from the structure of the antennæ. These are broad, flattened, and of large size; they bear on their margins multicellular hairs, surmounted by glands. Their bases are united into a single, rather narrow pedicel, and they thus appear like a great digitate expansion at one end of the bladder. Internally the quadrifid processes have divergent arms of equal length. The bladders contained remnants of articulate animals. [page 445] POLYPOMPHOLYX. This genus, which is confined to Western Australia, is characterised by having a “quadripartite calyx.” In other respects, as Prof. Oliver remarks,* “it is quite a Utricularia.” Polypompholyx multifida.—The bladders are attached in whorls round the summits of stiff stalks. The two antennæ are represented by a minute membranous fork, the basal part of which forms a sort of hood over the orifice. This hood expands into two wings on each side of the bladder. A third wing or crest appears to be formed by the extension of the dorsal surface of the petiole; but the structure of these three wings could not be clearly made out, owing to the state of the specimens. The inner surface of the hood is lined with long simple hairs, containing aggregated matter, like that within the quadrifid processes of the previously described species when in contact with decayed animals. These hairs appear therefore to serve as absorbents. A valve was seen, but its structure could not be determined. On the collar round the valve there are in the place of glands numerous one-celled papillae, having very short footstalks. The quadrifid processes have divergent arms of equal length. Remains of entomostracan crustaceans were found within the bladders. Polypompholyx tenella.—The bladders are smaller than those of the last species, but have the same general structure. They were full of dbris, apparently organic, but no remains of articulate animals could be distinguished. * ‘Proc. Linn. Soc.’ vol. iv. p. 171. [page 446] GENLISEA. This remarkable genus is technically distinguished from Utricularia, as I hear from Prof. Oliver, by having a five-partite calyx. Species are found in several parts of the world, and are said to be “herbae annuae paludosae.” Genlisea ornata (Brazil).—This species has been described and figured by Dr. Warming,* who states that it bears two kinds of leaves, called by him spathulate and utriculiferous. The latter include cavities; and as these differ much from the bladders of the foregoing species, it will be convenient to speak of them as utricles. The accompanying figure (fig. 29) of one of the utriculiferous leaves, about thrice enlarged, will illustrate the following description by my son, which agrees in all essential points with that given by Dr. Warming. The utricle (b) is formed by a slight enlargement of the narrow blade of the leaf. A hollow neck (n), no less than fifteen times as long as the utricle itself, forms a passage from the transverse slit-like orifice (o) into the cavity of the utricle. A utricle which measured 1/36 of an inch (.705 mm.,) in its longer diameter had a neck 15/36 (10.583 mm.) in length, and 1/100 of an inch (.254 mm.) in breadth. On each side of the orifice there is a long spiral arm or tube (a); the structure of which will be best understood by the following illustration. Take a narrow ribbon and wind it spirally round a thin cylinder, so that the edges come into contact along its whole length; then pinch up the two edges so as to form a little crest, which will of course wind spirally * “Bidrag til Kundskaben om Lentibulariaceae,” Copenhagen 1874. [page 447] round the cylinder like a thread round a screw. If the cylinder is now removed, we shall have a tube like one of the spiral arms. The two projecting edges are not actually united, and a needle can be pushed in easily between them. They are indeed in many places a little separated, forming narrow entrances into the tube; but this may be the result of the drying of the specimens. The lamina of which the tube is formed seems to be a lateral prolongation of the lip of the orifice; and the spiral line between the two projecting edges is continuous with the corner of the orifice. If a fine bristle is pushed down one of the arms, it passes into the top of the hollow neck. Whether the arms are open or closed at their extremities could not be determined, as all the specimens were broken; nor does it appear that Dr. Warming ascertained this point. FIG. 29. (Genlisea ornata.) Utriculiferous leaf; enlarged about three times. l Upper part of lamina of leaf. b Utricle or bladder. n Neck of utricle. o Orifice. a Spirally wound arms, with their ends broken off. So much for the external structure. Internally the lower part of the utricle is covered with spherical papillae, formed of four cells (sometimes eight according to Dr. Warming), which evidently answer to the quadrifid processes within the bladders of Utricularia. [page 448] These papillae extend a little way up the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the utricle; and a few, according to Warming, may be found in the upper part. This upper region is covered by many transverse rows, one above the other, of short, closely approximate hairs, pointing downwards. These hairs have broad bases, and their tips are formed by a separate cell. They are absent in the lower part of the utricle where the papillae abound. FIG. 30. (Genlisea ornata.) Portion of inside of neck leading into the utricle, greatly enlarged, showing the downward pointed bristles, and small quadrifid cells or processes. The neck is likewise lined throughout its whole length with transverse rows of long, thin, transparent hairs, having broad bulbous (fig. 30) bases, with similarly constructed sharp points. They arise from little projecting ridges, formed of rectangular epidermic cells. The hairs vary a little in length, but their points generally extend down to the row next below; so that if the neck is split open and laid flat, the inner surface resembles a paper of pins,—the hairs representing the pins, and the little transverse ridges representing the folds of paper through which the pins are thrust. These rows of hairs are indicated in the previous figure (29) by numerous transverse lines crossing the neck. The inside of the neck is [page 449] also studded with papillae; those in the lower part are spherical and formed of four cells, as in the lower part of the utricle; those in the upper part are formed of two cells, which are much elongated downwards beneath their points of attachment. These two-celled papillae apparently correspond with the bifid process in the upper part of the bladders of Utricularia. The narrow transverse orifice (o, fig. 29) is situated between the bases of the two spiral arms. No valve could be detected here, nor was any such structure seen by Dr. Warming. The lips of the orifice are armed with many short, thick, sharply pointed, somewhat incurved hairs or teeth. The two projecting edges of the spirally wound lamina, forming the arms, are provided with short incurved hairs or teeth, exactly like those on the lips. These project inwards at right angles to the spiral line of junction between the two edges. The inner surface of the lamina supports two-celled, elongated papillae, resembling those in the upper part of the neck, but differing slightly from them, according to Warming, in their footstalks being formed by prolongations of large epidermic cells; whereas the papillae within the neck rest on small cells sunk amidst the larger ones. These spiral arms form a conspicuous difference between the present genus and Utricularia. Lastly, there is a bundle of spiral vessels which, running up the lower part of the linear leaf, divides close beneath the utricle. One branch extends up the dorsal and the other up the ventral side of both the utricle and neck. Of these two branches, one enters one spiral arm, and the other branch the other arm. The utricles contained much dbris or dirty matter, which seemed organic, though no distinct organisms [page 450] could be recognised. It is, indeed, scarcely possible that any object could enter the small orifice and pass down the long narrow neck, except a living creature. Within the necks, however, of some specimens, a worm with retracted horny jaws, the abdomen of some articulate animal, and specks of dirt, probably the remnants of other minute creatures, were found. Many of the papillae within both the utricles and necks were discoloured, as if they had absorbed matter. From this description it is sufficiently obvious how Genlisea secures its prey. Small animals entering the narrow orifice—but what induces them to enter is not known any more than in the case of Utricularia—would find their egress rendered difficult by the sharp incurved hairs on the lips, and as soon as they passed some way down the neck, it would be scarcely possible for them to return, owing to the many transverse rows of long, straight, downward pointing hairs, together with the ridges from which these project. Such creatures would, therefore, perish either within the neck or utricle; and the quadrifid and bifid papillae would absorb matter from their decayed remains. The transverse rows of hairs are so numerous that they seem superfluous merely for the sake of preventing the escape of prey, and as they are thin and delicate, they probably serve as additional absorbents, in the same manner as the flexible bristles on the infolded margins of the leaves of Aldrovanda. The spiral arms no doubt act as accessory traps. Until fresh leaves are examined, it cannot be told whether the line of junction of the spirally wound lamina is a little open along its whole course, or only in parts, but a small creature which forced its way into the tube at any point, would be prevented from escaping by the incurved hairs, and would find an open path down [page 451] the tube into the neck, and so into the utricle. If the creature perished within the spiral arms, its decaying remains would be absorbed and utilised by the bifid papillae. We thus see that animals are captured by Genlisea, not by means of an elastic valve, as with the foregoing species, but by a contrivance resembling an eel-trap, though more complex. Genlisea africana (South Africa).—Fragments of the utriculiferous leaves of this species exhibited the same structure as those of Genlisea ornata. A nearly perfect Acarus was found within the utricle or neck of one leaf, but in which of the two was not recorded. Genlisea aurea (Brazil).—A fragment of the neck of a utricle was lined with transverse rows of hairs, and was furnished with elongated papillae, exactly like those within the neck of Genlisea ornata. It is probable, therefore, that the whole utricle is similarly constructed. Genlisea filiformis (Bahia, Brazil).—Many leaves were examined and none were found provided with utricles, whereas such leaves were found without difficulty in the three previous species. On the other hand, the rhizomes bear bladders resembling in essential character those on the rhizomes of Utricularia. These bladders are transparent, and very small, viz. Only 1/100 of an inch (.254 mm.) in length. The antennæ are not united at their bases, and apparently bear some long hairs. On the outside of the bladders there are only a few papillae, and internally very few quadrifid processes. These latter, however, are of unusually large size, relatively to the bladder, with the four divergent arms of equal length. No prey could be seen within these minute bladders. As the rhizomes of this species were furnished with bladders, those of Genlisea africana, ornata, and aurea were carefully [page 452] examined, but none could be found. What are we to infer from these facts? Did the three species just named, like their close allies, the several species of Utricularia, aboriginally possess bladders on their rhizomes, which they afterwards lost, acquiring in their place utriculiferous leaves? In support of this view it may be urged that the bladders of Genlisea filiformis appear from their small size and from the fewness of their quadrifid processes to be tending towards abortion; but why has not this species acquired utriculiferous leaves, like its congeners? CONCLUSION. It has now been shown that many species of Utricularia and of two closely allied genera, inhabiting the most distant parts of the world—Europe, Africa, India, the Malay Archipelago, Australia, North and South America—are admirably adapted for capturing by two methods small aquatic or terrestrial animals, and that they absorb the products of their decay. Ordinary plants of the higher classes procure the requisite inorganic elements from the soil by means of their roots, and absorb carbonic acid from the atmosphere by means of their leaves and stems. But we have seen in a previous part of this work that there is a class of plants which digest and afterwards absorb animal matter, namely, all the Droseraceae, Pinguicula, and, as discovered by Dr. Hooker, Nepenthes, and to this class other species will almost certainly soon be added. These plants can dissolve matter out of certain vegetable substances, such as pollen, seeds, and bits of leaves. No doubt their glands likewise absorb the salts of ammonia brought to them by the rain. It has also been shown that some other plants can absorb ammonia by [page 453] their glandular hairs; and these will profit by that brought to them by the rain. There is a second class of plants which, as we have just seen, cannot digest, but absorb the products of the decay of the animals which they capture, namely, Utricularia and its close allies; and from the excellent observations of Dr. Mellichamp and Dr. Canby, there can scarcely be a doubt that Sarracenia and Darlingtonia may be added to this class, though the fact can hardly be considered as yet fully proved. There is a third class of plants which feed, as is now generally admitted, on the products of the decay of vegetable matter, such as the bird’s-nest orchis (Neottia), &c. Lastly, there is the well-known fourth class of parasites (such as the mistletoe), which are nourished by the juices of living plants. Most, however, of the plants belonging to these four classes obtain part of their carbon, like ordinary species, from the atmosphere. Such are the diversified means, as far as at present known, by which higher plants gain their subsistence. INDEX. A.

Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™ electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment. 1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees.

LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem. 1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE. 1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions. 1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any Defect you cause. Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™ Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life. Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org. Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws. The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate. While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate. Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org. This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
